00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:56,399
Starbucks IPO just the IPO that episode

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,399
was a mere 1 hour and 24 minutes and

21
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,359
Starbucks is a 90 billion institution in

22
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:04,360
our world that deserves the full

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,400
acquired treatment what were we thinking

24
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,920
well it actually was Amateur hour back

25
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,119
then David got to start somewhere well

26
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:13,960
today we have a very special third

27
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,479
co-host to discuss this third place

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,520
Howard Schultz Howard started working at

29
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,479
the small chain of three Starbucks

30
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,439
stores in 1982 eventually buying it and

31
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,479
becoming CEO as you probably know he is

32
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:28,720
effectively the founder of the Starbucks

33
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:31,280
we know today that exists on every

34
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,200
corner of the Earth I come to you David

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,600
and listeners as an unabashed Starbucks

36
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:38,479
fan in this tumultuous time for the

37
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:40,439
company I am absolutely pulling for them

38
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,520
in every way possible and that is going

39
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,000
to come through in our conversation you

40
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,960
may have seen the news recently that

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,159
they had a very rough last quarter with

42
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,439
a key metric that you may remember from

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,880
previous episodes as same store sales

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:56,280
these dropped and their stock price

45
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,600
plummeted as a result this is on top of

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,039
a tumultuous pandemic era and some of

47
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,000
their stores unionized and a change in

48
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,759
leadership we thought that this would be

49
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
the perfect time to sit down with Howard

50
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:10,399
and unpack why did Starbucks work in the

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,080
first place and how did it work at such

52
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,040
Grand scale what can other Founders and

53
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,400
Business Leaders learn from what got

54
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,519
them here and although he is no longer

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,599
CEO where do they go now it really is

56
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,760
incredible one of the very very small

57
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,760
number of food and beverage

58
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,000
establishments that has scaled to the

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,640
entire world yeah most of those types of

60
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,440
Concepts do not work in different

61
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,360
countries and continents but Starbucks

62
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,000
is different today they're in over 80

63
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,000
countries with 39,000 stores across the

64
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,040
world they're even huge in China a

65
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,280
country that didn't consume very much

66
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,720
coffee until Starbucks arrived they are

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,680
a bank scale financial institution as

68
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,200
well at any given time Starbucks holds

69
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,200
$1.7 billion doar that customers have

70
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,760
loaded onto gift cards but not yet spent

71
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,239
so how did they go from one store

72
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,959
selling beans not even drinks and cups

73
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:04,840

74
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,720

75
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,799

think I've told you this off camera for

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:50,479
the last almost 10 years every single

119
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,000
day starts with a spinach and feder app

120
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,720
I assume there are other people like me

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:55,320
in the world but it's always an iced

122
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,120
almond milk latte with whipped cream and

123
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,919
a spinach and feter wrap and so thank

124
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,759

125
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,720
of the cells in my

body that's a great start I also here's

127
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,759
another stat that David you've done the

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,280
math on I have done the math I exported

129
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:14,160
all of my credit card transactions since

130
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,440
2011 of course you did and I wish I had

131
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,639
more history than that but that was the

132
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,240
oldest I could get I've spent

133
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:26,160
$23,000 at Starbucks since 2011 oh God

134
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:30,880
okay so we want to start with Starbucks

135
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:33,600
1.0 and listeners May know that there

136
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,680
were three founders of Starbucks yes

137
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:39,440
none of which were named Howard Schultz

138
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,160
correct so take us back you know in the

139
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,479
Starbucks prehistory before you arrived

140
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,600
how did the company start well since I

141
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:49,639
wasn't there this is what I know there

142
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,560
were three founders Jerry Baldwin Zev

143
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:55,400
seagull and Gordon

144
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,440
balker and the story that was told to me

145
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,720
is that one or both of them were going

146
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,960
to school in California in the B area

147
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,240
and they became enamored with Pete's

148
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,440
Coffee Company uh which Alfred Pete

149
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,680
Alfred Pete was you know more than

150
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,720
anyone else in the history of coffee in

151
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:19,000
America was the true Pioneer he

152
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,960
brought specialy coffee a Raba coffee to

153
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,919
Northern

154
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:26,199
California and Jerry Baldwin and Zev

155
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,759
became so interested and intrigued with

156
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,680
what pets was doing and given the fact

157
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:33,199
that they were from seatt attle decided

158
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,000
they would try and bring Starbucks

159
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,160
coffee in the form of Starbucks to

160
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,160
Seattle Washington now what is not known

161
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,840
is that when Starbucks opened in the

162
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:46,360
Pike Place Market in

163
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:49,560
1971 they were using Pete's Coffee

164
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,800
really no one knows that that's new WoW

165
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,280
because they they were not roasting

166
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,000
coffee so they were bringing coffee from

167
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,319
s Francisco to Seattle they were not

168
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
calling it Pete's they were calling it

169
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,479
Starbucks so it was Pete's Coffee and

170
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,720
Starbucks yeah yeah again I wasn't there

171
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,400
but that's kind of the

172
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:08,479
folklore after the three

173
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:11,319
founders built that store open that

174
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:13,240
store uh I I get the sense that there

175
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,639
was some kind of Fallout between the

176
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,199
three of them and Zev seagull eventually

177
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:21,280
left the

178
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:25,680
company that brings us to

179
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,560
1979 1980 around that time when I came

180
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,520
to Seattle Washington for the first time

181
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,360
so I was working for a Swedish

182
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:37,919
housewares company based in Sweden

183
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,960
called Hammer plast that company had a

184
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:45,479
beautiful non-electric coffee maker kind

185
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,560
of a thermal unit and we had a big

186
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:50,120
customer in Macy's in Northern

187
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,720
California and I was in California on a

188
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:54,000
sales call and I had heard that there

189
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,199
was a small company in Seattle

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,599
Washington was buying a lot of this

191
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,360
product so given the fact I'd never been

192
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:01,159
to Seattle I was already on the west

193
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,199
coast I figured I'd come to Seattle and

194
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,720
see what was going on was Starbucks

195
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:07,720
buying it for use in they were selling

196
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,280
it in their store now but here's the

197
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,840
thing this was a consumer device yeah

198
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:16,440
yeah but you have to remember Starbucks

199
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:20,759
Coffee Company from 1971 until around

200
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,520
8586 only sold pounds of coffee there

201
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:24,080
was no beverage that's you know we're

202
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:27,639
going to get into the epiphany of that

203
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,280
of course and so I walked into the Pike

204
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:33,320
Place store for the first time on a

205
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:36,599
beautiful day just like this the sun was

206
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,839
out there was snow on the mountains the

207
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:41,120
clean fresh air and I walked into the

208
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,360
Pik Place Market and I walked into the

209
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,480
Starbucks store and I was blown away by

210
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,399
the experience the the romance of coffee

211
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,560
the

212
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:54,600
education and it just spoke to me I had

213
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:58,279
never met Jerry Baldin the founder who

214
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,920
was the CEO at the time and I became

215
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,959
interested and intrigued with with what

216
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:04,600
Starbucks was doing and asked if I could

217
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,440
meet Jerry one thing led to another I

218
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:09,880
met Jerry Baldwin we really hit it off

219
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:12,120
and we established kind of a vendor

220
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:15,440
customer relationship over a course of a

221
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,959
year or so Starbucks had three stores at

222
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:22,680
the time only three and over the course

223
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:25,760
of the next year or so I became more and

224
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,839
more interested and intrigued with the

225
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,640
possibility of leaving New York City

226
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:35,200
Sher and I were dating we not married

227
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:38,760
and I kind of maneuvered my way into a

228
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,120
job working for Starbucks and so Sherry

229
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,399
and I drove to Seattle Washington on

230
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,640
Labor Day weekend in our old Audi car

231
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,160
with a golden

232
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:50,079
retriever and we came here because I was

233
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:51,880
offered the job as the head of marketing

234
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,160
for Starbucks when they were getting

235
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:58,079
ready to open their fourth store in

236
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:00,200
1982 still just selling beans only beans

237
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:01,800
that's the whole yeah still

238
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,440
the interest that the company had in me

239
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,959
at the time I think was they were really

240
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:09,720
interested in expanding but their their

241
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:11,440
dream or or the plan at the time was

242
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,320
could we expand to Portland

243
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:17,600
Oregon remember so it was a tiny company

244
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,680
was Grand ambition yeah and I never had

245
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,959
any idea of course that what was about

246
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,640
to happen and unfold of the subsequent

247
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:28,680
years but that was I arrived in 1982 as

248
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,519
a head of marketing so when you and

249
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,200
Sherry arrived drive here like what was

250
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,079
the coffee landscape I mean there were

251
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,120
these three soon to be four Starbucks

252
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:41,000
Bean stores here in Seattle Alfred Pete

253
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,920
was down in the Bay

254
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:45,360
Area but what was Coffee Culture I mean

255
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,480
it was it was like folders in Maxwell

256
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,560
House right yeah it was uh it was di

257
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,760
minimist it was another coffee company

258
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,760
which was Seattle's Best Coffee which

259
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,639
was another retailer that was kind of at

260
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,959
the same size and scale at Starbucks

261
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:01,079
both equal at the same time but you

262
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,519
couldn't get a New York Times in Seattle

263
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:07,519
in 1982 83 it was not no good food to

264
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,720
speak of and Starbucks was a true

265
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,639
Pioneer where they were

266
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:14,680
educating customer after customer about

267
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:16,800
what good coffee tastes like and the

268
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,680
pipe Place Market gave them an

269
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,440
interesting vehicle because of of the

270
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:24,079
tur and so Starbucks actually started

271
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,959
establishing a mail order business as a

272
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,440
result of all the people who were coming

273
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:32,320
into Seattle and I think if I remember

274
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:35,079
there was so many points that I can

275
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,839
remember where people were talking about

276
00:11:35,079 --> 00:11:41,760
Starbucks Way outside of Seattle as if

277
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:43,880
it was some kind of iconic big company I

278
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:46,560
think people came to Seattle is this it

279
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:48,639
this is you know the 8900 Foot Store in

280
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,440
Seattle Washington in Pike Place Market

281
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:52,600
this is the Mecca and so tourists would

282
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,920
come they would buy a bag and then they

283
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,519
would fill out some kind of information

284
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,760
so I'd like to I'd like to have this

285
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:02,279
mailed to me gr mail bus in my city yeah

286
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,560
that's what happened and because coffee

287
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,279
has a shelf life of basically a week to

288
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:10,519
10 days and we didn't have a vacuum bag

289
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,600
at that time we were shipping small

290
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:16,720
amounts because to Jerry Baldwin's

291
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,519
credit he had such a fastidious point of

292
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,639
view about quality and freshness and I

293
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,000
think that had a huge impact on me but

294
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,120
this couldn't have been like a great

295
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,240
business you're shipping small amounts

296
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,920
the logistics costs you know the scale

297
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:37,600
like this was a small business but the

298
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:39,639
equity of the brand even back then was

299
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,639
much larger than the size of the

300
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:44,959
business and the opportunity that I saw

301
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:47,320
even when we had four or five stores was

302
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,760
well beyond Portland Oregon and I was

303
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:51,360
always kind of pushing we can do so much

304
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,760
more and then the whole thing blew up

305
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:57,480
for me when I went to Italy in 83 okay

306
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:00,240
so before the Italy trip I just want to

307
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:03,320
really contextualize coffee and

308
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,560
America I think coffee had been

309
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:08,160
declining since like 1940 still part of

310
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,800
the American culture but it's not that

311
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,800
it's on the way out but there's nothing

312
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,160
new or interesting except for this

313
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:18,160
little segment of specially coffee which

314
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:19,959
was Tiny and I think what you've just

315
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,000
described the reason for that is the

316
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:24,639
coffee was terrible it was instant

317
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,440
coffee stale coffee and primarily

318
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,279
robusta beans which is the lowgrade

319
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,800
coffee that Starbucks was never never

320
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:33,720
involved in yeah walk us through the two

321
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,959
types of beans there's mainly two types

322
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:39,360
of agricultural coffee grown for

323
00:13:35,959 --> 00:13:42,399
commercial use robusta beans low-end

324
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:45,000
coffee primarily and instant coffee and

325
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,720
high-grade arabica coffee but even

326
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:50,199
within the arabica coffee there's

327
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,839
significant segments of quality and

328
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:56,279
integrity and Starbucks was has always

329
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:57,880
played from 1971 to today at the highest

330
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,079
level and my understanding from our

331
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,800
research is that the a market really

332
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:04,279
developed as you say with the instant

333
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,920
coffee market and that was kind of a

334
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:07,920
product of World War II right it was

335
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,160
like Hey we got to get the troops this

336
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:12,240
product to survive and so we just need a

337
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,199
lot of beans and we need to ground them

338
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,800
up and create this instant product I

339
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:17,959
believe Maxwell House was involved in

340
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:22,720
inventing yeah you're exactly right I

341
00:14:17,959 --> 00:14:24,959
mean it was just Fuel and bitter acidic

342
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:28,199
and yeah and that's I think World War II

343
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:30,360
and the gis were kind of the impetus for

344
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:33,519
that kind of quality coffee or not

345
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:36,839
quality coffee to exist and have any

346
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:39,040
kind of run after the war so you show up

347
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:40,759
at Starbucks you know you know a little

348
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:43,639
bit about the market because you've been

349
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,680
a A supplier of theirs but you happen to

350
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:47,759
be a pretty talented salesman from your

351
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:49,920
your time at Xerox and I want to make a

352
00:14:47,759 --> 00:14:51,800
tie here our previous episode was the

353
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,839
Microsoft episode or at least Microsoft

354
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:57,360
volume one you were selling word

355
00:14:54,839 --> 00:15:01,360
processors made by Xerox tell me what

356
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:07,440
word processors were in the mid 70s

357
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:09,959
so my territory was 42nd to 48th Street

358
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:12,720
from Fifth Avenue to the river and I had

359
00:15:09,959 --> 00:15:14,040
to make 50 cold calls physical cold

360
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,199
calls a

361
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:21,959
day that was a job the Xerox job taught

362
00:15:18,199 --> 00:15:23,880
me incredible amounts about not only

363
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:27,199
selling but

364
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:29,759
humility humility because the rejection

365
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,360
every day was so sign significant and

366
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,759
you put on your suit and tie and you go

367
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,920
in an office building there's no

368
00:15:32,759 --> 00:15:36,800
security at that time just go in and you

369
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,959
go from the top floor to the bottom and

370
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,839
then there were other people selling

371
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,240
other products who are doing the exact

372
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:46,680
same thing and you had to get by the

373
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:48,480
receptionist I was making ,000 a month

374
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:51,519
and living at home when I

375
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:55,160
started okay the word processor was a

376
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:58,000
big machine in which you are editing on

377
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:00,759
that machine to basically create a

378
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,360
letter and does it have a screen or is

379
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:04,079
like a typewriter no it's a typewriter

380
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,120
no screen it's like a typewriter with

381
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,279
like a with a little bit of cash right

382
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:11,000
so you could like exctly fix mistakes

383
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,839
for one line right yeah the job at Xerox

384
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,759
at the time was like working for Google

385
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,480
I mean Xerox and IBM were the two

386
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:19,360
pillars of technology and high-tech

387
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:21,399
companies you told somebody you working

388
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,319
at Xerox you had a whole different

389
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,120
patina that you were wow that's working

390
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:29,240
for zerox Wow and so you quitting well

391
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,600
Hammer plast but you know quitting what

392
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,600
seemed like a I hated it stable of

393
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,639
pretty good jobs to drive across the

394
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,920
country to provincial little Seattle I

395
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,480
mean that's that's

396
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:42,959
nuts I knew after a couple of years if I

397
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,959
stayed at Xerox for a a longer period of

398
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:47,959
time I was going to be locked in there

399
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:50,800
but I'll tell you the story that got me

400
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:53,680
to realize I've got to get out of here

401
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,880
at the end of the year the performance

402
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,160
appraisal at Xerox was basically a

403
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,639
scorecard from 1 to five so you'd have a

404
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:04,120
qualitative discussion with your manager

405
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,360
and then he would give you a

406
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:09,480
number and when I got a

407
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:11,959
three I said I you know I just saying to

408
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,839
myself I worked all year I just had an

409
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:16,480
performance appr for my manager and I'm

410
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:18,400
a three this is amazing Howard Schultz

411
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,000
got a three I got a three I got a three

412
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,079
inspiration for all entrepreneur I got a

413
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,160
three and as soon as I got the three I

414
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,760
swear at that moment I knew I've got to

415
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:30,679
get out of here and that's when I

416
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:33,039
started putting myself in a position of

417
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,000
meet other opportunities and by and

418
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,880
large I was able to get the hammer plast

419
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,799
job which was the general manager of the

420
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,720
company which was based in Sweden in the

421
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:48,440
US but I was a three do you think having

422
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:50,919
that background at Xerox did that give

423
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:53,039
you a piece of perspective that helped

424
00:17:50,919 --> 00:17:55,720
build Starbucks to what it is

425
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,840
today when I hear the question I I have

426
00:17:55,720 --> 00:18:00,840
to go back to my childhood and think

427
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,360
everything that have experienced growing

428
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,559
up in the

429
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:10,120
projects in more or less a dysfunctional

430
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:12,799
family because of the the pressure of

431
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:15,360
Money Getting the Xerox

432
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:17,960
opportunity and having some level of

433
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,360
success but realizing I wanted

434
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:24,640
more the humility which came with

435
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,919
rejection the shame I had as a poor kid

436
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:31,679
living in the projects all of that I

437
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:34,280
think crystallized in me and I give Sher

438
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:35,880
so much credit in realizing that

439
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,280
together we wanted to build a different

440
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:44,760
kind of life and gave me the Courage the

441
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:47,799
conviction and um the drive to try and

442
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:49,600
do something that I felt I was destined

443
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:51,280
to do I didn't know what it was I

444
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,200
certainly didn't know moving to Seattle

445
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,960
was going to create the opportunity of a

446
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,280
lifetime but I always felt I had to get

447
00:18:55,960 --> 00:19:02,039
out of that station in life where I was

448
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,760
positioned not to get to the level that

449
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:09,120
I thought I I deserve to be I don't

450
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:11,840
think it is common with someone for your

451
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:14,919
background poor kid in the projects

452
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:17,440
coming from nothing to get a great job

453
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:20,080
two great jobs and be wildly

454
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,240
dissatisfied and not feel like I've made

455
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,080
it but rather no there's got to be

456
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:27,760
something more than this there's

457
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,880
something deep inside you that caused

458
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:34,200
you to be willing to take take a risk I

459
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,080
was really insecure about not

460
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,400
succeeding and I didn't view what I was

461
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,840
doing as the success that I was not

462
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:47,120
destined for that's that sounds wrong

463
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,240
that that I had the appetite for all

464
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,880
right so we're getting to the big risk

465
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:55,600
so the year takes over to 1983 yeah you

466
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,640
are sent or maybe you asked to go to an

467
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,080
international housewares conference in

468
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:03,679
Milan yeah what do you discover so I

469
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:06,400
went to a trade show called

470
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:08,600
machf uh it's big convention center and

471
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,559
a it's a giant houseware show with

472
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,880
equipment and all kinds of stuff and I I

473
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:16,159
was staying at a a relatively cheap

474
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:18,520
hotel in walking distant to the

475
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,440
convention center I get out of the hotel

476
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:24,880
I'd never been to Italy before and I am

477
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:27,960
all of a sudden being intercepted with

478
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:30,760
the physical manifestation of one coffee

479
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:33,440
bar after after another in the business

480
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:35,240
that I'm supposed to be in but it wasn't

481
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,799
the business that Starbucks was in and I

482
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:39,480
walk in like a normal person that's

483
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,480
never seen this before and I am just

484
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:45,520
like I'm in a black and white movie and

485
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:46,840
all of a sudden everything was color and

486
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,960
it was so

487
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,559
rich I couldn't get enough of it and I

488
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:55,159
just went from one to the other to the

489
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:58,120
other to the other and

490
00:20:55,159 --> 00:21:01,280
I I was just blown away and more or less

491
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:04,720
raced back to America sat down with

492
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,880
Jerry and Gordon and said holy

493
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,840
 we got happening in in Italy is the

494
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:13,640
business that Starbucks has to be in and

495
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:16,760
they had seen it they've been Italy and

496
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:20,600
they said no that's not what we want to

497
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:24,159
do and I just said seriously and I

498
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:26,880
banged on the door for two years and in

499
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:30,120
two years they finally let me open up a

500
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:32,360
coffee bar on the corner of fourth and

501
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,039
spring in Seattle and it was the sixth

502
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,840
Starbucks store and out of about 1,200

503
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,000
square fet I got 100 feet and I designed

504
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,760
and opened the coffee bar worked behind

505
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:47,240
the counter as a barista and Starbucks

506
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,960
probably had two to 300 customers a day

507
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:52,960
selling hobing coffee we were at 500 in

508
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,080
a week with introducing lattes and

509
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,320
cappuccino to the an espresso and

510
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,120
there's nowhere else no one in Seattle

511
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,360
had it well get

512
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:05,720
had it and that was Dave olon and after

513
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:09,000
a few months or six months or so Jerry

514
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,360
said I don't want to repeat this I don't

515
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,120
want to do it I don't want to be in the

516
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,960
restaurant business yeah what was the

517
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:16,080
objection was it the he he just he

518
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:17,320
stigma of the restaurant business I mean

519
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,200
I don't want to speak for Jerry I have

520
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:21,880
so much respect for him but he didn't

521
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,120
think it was clean he didn't like it now

522
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:27,559
between 83 and

523
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:29,120
885 Jerry Baldwin because of his love of

524
00:22:27,559 --> 00:22:31,480
pets

525
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,520
and his relation with Alfred Pete had an

526
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:36,200
opportunity for Starbucks to acquire

527
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,760
Pete's Coffee company and they

528
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,120
did

529
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:43,760
unfortunately Starbucks buys pets and

530
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,400
they get into financial trouble and so

531
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:47,360
really at this point it was like their

532
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,360
Mentor was retiring this person who was

533
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,520
a steward of the industry we operating

534
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,279
six points of retail distribution in

535
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,960
Seattle for our beans why don't we just

536
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:59,559
buy your effectively the same business

537
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,600
but in Northern California keep them SE

538
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:04,840
well it's important to know that between

539
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:07,039
the opening of the fourth and spring

540
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,120
coffee bar inside of Starbucks Starbucks

541
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:11,720
number six yeah and Jerry and Gordon

542
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:13,880
saying we don't want to repeat this I

543
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:14,919
was so frustrated I said I'm going to

544
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,200
leave

545
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:23,200
Starbucks and what did I do I had no

546
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:26,440
money to open up a coffee store so Jerry

547
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,720
says Starbucks does not want to open up

548
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:32,840
coffee bars but we will in invest in il

549
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,080
jali which was the company you started

550
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,799
too yeah so before they get into

551
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:39,480
financial trouble Starbucks is an

552
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,600
investor I've always thought he did that

553
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,640
so I would sell and Market Starbucks

554
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:48,640
coffee in the coffee bar which I would

555
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:50,880
have done anyway so Starbucks makes an

556
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,360
investment a couple of people that we

557
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:55,559
know make an investment but I didn't

558
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,279
have enough money so I go to see two

559
00:23:55,559 --> 00:24:01,360
Italian companies I've never told this

560
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:04,440
one is the espresso company

561
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,559
FMA and one is the large Italian Coffee

562
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:10,520
Company lavat oh yeah and I asked them

563
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:13,640
both to invest in my

564
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:15,520
idea and both of them turned me down so

565
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,480
at this point you're in Italy you're

566
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:19,840
trying to get ideas and investors for

567
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:21,960
what would become IL Al for the first Al

568
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:23,159
and only Starbucks and a couple other

569
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:25,159
people have committed but I didn't have

570
00:24:23,159 --> 00:24:28,120
enough money I still I needed more money

571
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:31,039
huh and you were raising 1.6 million

572
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:33,480
about 1 Point yeah 1.6 1.7 million and

573
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:37,039
they said you know no one is going

574
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:38,799
to buy Italian espresso in Seattle or In

575
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,720
America which is stupid because you

576
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,159
watched it happen like I ran this store

577
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:43,399
for six months and like it was flying

578
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,440
you know yeah they didn't want to do it

579
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:50,679
so they they lva and FMA just get that

580
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:53,600
on the record turned me down okay

581
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,880
they'll deny it that's a fact so then I

582
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:00,039
you know go back to the US I'm trying to

583
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:01,000
raise money and I I hit the three Titans

584
00:25:00,039 --> 00:25:04,600
in

585
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,360
Seattle Jack beroya Herman sharkowski

586
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:10,080
and Sam

587
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,360
strong three of the leading citizens of

588
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:13,799
Seattle Washington at the time and the

589
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,720
three of them have a little bit of an

590
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:19,600
investment together and other things and

591
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,640
they say we're going to believe in you

592
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,679
and they take me over the the hump wow

593
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:28,720
okay and we opened three ill jali's two

594
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:32,760
in Seattle one in Vancouver BC

595
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:36,440
and all three are doing well all three

596
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:38,200
but I didn't have enough money to expand

597
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,880
and needing the money to expand just to

598
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:43,000
pause on that for a minute

599
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,880
business-wise obviously coffee bars are

600
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
a much better business long term than

601
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:49,880
coffee beans but probably more Capital

602
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,159
intensive right you need more staff yeah

603
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:53,720
more labor yes but the stores weren't

604
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,480
that expensive to open because they were

605
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,799
small less than a th000 square fet and

606
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,320
we we understood how to do it and I was

607
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:03,039
working as a barista with Dave Olson and

608
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:05,080
other people keep the cost down we were

609
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,679
behind the counter and I had no salary I

610
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:09,399
had no salary for almost two years wow

611
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,720
while Sher was working and pregnant with

612
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:13,679
our first child so looking increasingly

613
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,840
worse from a traditional perspective of

614
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:18,679
leaving a high quality job moving across

615
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,200
the country then just a couple years

616
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:23,640
later you are not making any money again

617
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,880
well raising millions of dollars to try

618
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,960
to start your own business it gets

619
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,600
worse Sherry is sick seven months

620
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:35,600
pregnant she's working her parents

621
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,600
visits y they're from Ohio father asked

622
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:44,799
me to take a walk oh no as godess my way

623
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:48,039
is true story take a walk and he says

624
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:51,279
uh whatever you're doing I respect it

625
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:52,720
but it's not a job it's a hobby you need

626
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,640
to get a

627
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:59,960
job my daughter's pregnant she's working

628
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:03,520
you're not I start crying I bet so

629
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:04,840
embarrassed and uh I come home at 3 4:00

630
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,799
in the afternoon whatever it is I don't

631
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,600
say a

632
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,760
word completely shaken by the whole

633
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,080
conversation her parents go to bed after

634
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,159
dinner I'm sitting with Sherry and I

635
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,640
said I got to tell you something to

636
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:20,320
happen she was so angry at her dad and

637
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:23,720
so upset and she said there's no way

638
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,640
we're turning around we're we are going

639
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,880
so she is the glue to everything that's

640
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,360
happened

641
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,520
and I don't know if she've ever had a

642
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:33,640
conversation with her father I'm sure

643
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:35,799
she did I don't but the whole thing

644
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,200
could have been over and that would have

645
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:40,480
been a very understandable response of

646
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Sher said I'm you know I wasn't going to

647
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,240
say anything but you know look at our

648
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,720
situation objectively here putting

649
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,279
ourselves in your father in-law's shoes

650
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:49,320
how could you not feel that way for your

651
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:52,519
daughter and her impending family yeah

652
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:55,480
and and her father was a great guy and

653
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:59,679
uh I understood but I was embarrassed

654
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:01,519
and humiliated How can I not be mean I

655
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,360
guess that's another dimension here too

656
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:06,360
this was not 2024 it's not like being an

657
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,519
entrepreneur was a you know glorified

658
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,320
profession here in a business that he

659
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:13,840
clearly did not understand you know

660
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:15,840
coffee store the other interesting thing

661
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,080
to point out around this time is for the

662
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,279
people who were seeking high-risk

663
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:25,120
business Investments you know this is

664
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,159
the late 80s it's time to look at Tech

665
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,720
like we're now 12 years into Microsoft

666
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,840
apples four years past the

667
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,279
Macintosh and I'm I'm trying you're

668
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:37,120
trying to raise money for a coffee house

669
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:40,039
chain with names that people couldn't

670
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:42,919
pronounce and serving it in a paper

671
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:44,279
cup to go that does not sound Innovative

672
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:47,399
to me I don't know why I'm putting my

673
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,480
risk Capital into your yeah you know I

674
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:53,200
would bring investors to the two or

675
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:56,559
three stores and I would make sure there

676
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,440
was a fair amount of people in the space

677
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:01,720
and that's when I started talking

678
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,519
about the language of community in the

679
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:07,360
third place and that's what I saw in

680
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:09,919
Italy the unlock and the epiphany of

681
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:12,039
course it was the romance of espresso

682
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:15,000
but it was the sense of community and

683
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,919
that is what was happening very early on

684
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:19,159
in the two stores in Seattle and the one

685
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:20,880
in Vancouver you could see it what would

686
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:22,600
people do after they bought the coffee

687
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,799
you said these are very small places

688
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,760
they would stand up because the two

689
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,039
stores didn't have seating right away

690
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,000
they would stand up at the coffee bar at

691
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,880
the window on Columbia Center and it was

692
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,080
at at 8 9:00 in the morning they were

693
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:37,600
hanging out there and then they after

694
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,399
late morning they were coming back and

695
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,120
you could just feel the relationship

696
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,440
that people were having with one another

697
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,159
around human

698
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,240
connection I know it sounds trite but I

699
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:50,760
I could see it back then and as I was

700
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:53,080
talking to people about the investment

701
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,159
opportunity I was pointing out like look

702
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,679
what's happening here there's something

703
00:29:55,159 --> 00:29:58,720
happening there's some magic going on

704
00:29:56,679 --> 00:29:59,960
here it's not just the Cofe coffee the

705
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
coffee was the

706
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,039
conduit all right so we're at the

707
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:06,320
pivotal moment Starbucks and petza gets

708
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:08,559
into financial trouble and the debt to

709
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,360
equity was north of 6 to1 for a company

710
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,880
was

711
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:17,159
Tiny Jerry comes to me and

712
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:20,880
says Jane and I his wife are going to

713
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:23,320
move to California and we're gonna keep

714
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,559
Pete's and I'm going to sell

715
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:27,000
Starbucks and my heart is pounding I

716
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:31,000
said okay and then he finish it and he

717
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
says I think you're the person to buy

718
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,200
Starbucks I said that's fantastic but I

719
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:41,080
don't have any money you get to give it

720
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,840
to me no money how much is it $3.8

721
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:47,679
million now we're in 86

722
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,799
87 now we get into a story I have told

723
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,559
but not 100% because I protected the guy

724
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,960
but I'm going to tell it I go out to

725
00:30:53,559 --> 00:30:57,600
raise money I'm having a hard time so

726
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,000
Jerry gave me about I think he gave me

727
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,080
99 days to raise $3.8

728
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,880
million around the second month he just

729
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:07,399
came to me and said where are you with

730
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,519
all this and I I think I had about half

731
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,880
of it raised I might have fibd a bit and

732
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:14,799
said I had a little bit more but I I

733
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,720
didn't I had about half and he lays a

734
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:22,039
bomb on me and says Howard listen we're

735
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,240
in a tight situation here and one of

736
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:26,760
your

737
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:29,240
investors has put a cash all cash offer

738
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:31,440
on the table with with no due diligence

739
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:33,600
and wants to close right away for him to

740
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:36,440
take it over not you yeah yeah I'm out

741
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:43,120
I'd be out and I said who is

742
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:46,799
it and he told me I'll save that and I'm

743
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,000
absolutely annihilated crushed because I

744
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:50,639
didn't have the wherewithal and I could

745
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,960
just Envision as soon as I heard that

746
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:56,600
name I knew was

747
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,720
over I was in a basketball league at the

748
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:01,200
Seattle Club

749
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,679
I'm playing basketball that night my

750
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,600
good friend Scott Greenberg who's an

751
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:09,120
attorney at uh a Prestige firm in

752
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,919
Seattle the gates

753
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:14,159
firm I'm basically crying to him after

754
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:15,799
the game and telling him the story and

755
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,880
he says you got to come to the office

756
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:23,120
tomorrow and meet our senior partner and

757
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,799
tell him the story Bill Gates

758
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:28,639
Senior I said well a Titan incredible

759
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,159
the other we foreshadowed this m episode

760
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:36,240
there were there were three Titans there

761
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:39,440
but here is the Titan and Bill was 6'7

762
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,159
he's 6' s a mountain of a man and very

763
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:44,720
imposing so 9:00 in the

764
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:47,279
morning I put a suit

765
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,279
on I must have been sweating through my

766
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:51,799
shirt I was just so anxious so nervous

767
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:54,600
and at the same time so scared about

768
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:57,080
what's going to happen I go in

769
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:00,720
there and I I I must have been trembling

770
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:03,480
I I I I was is so nervous I tell him

771
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,159
exactly what I just told him and he

772
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,279
interrupts me and says Howard I'm just

773
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:09,000
going to ask you two questions is

774
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:13,399
everything you told me

775
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:16,440
true I said Mr Gates yes have you left

776
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:19,559
anything out

777
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:23,360
no and he says come back in an

778
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,720
hour and I said okay to do what he says

779
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:28,120
I'll see you in an hour and so we walk

780
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,960
out and walking around I think we

781
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,200
probably went to went to Columbia Center

782
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:35,159
to get a coffee and come back and go

783
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:36,960
back with Scott and Mr Gat says Scott

784
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,320
I'm going to see how we're alone and

785
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,440
Scott Le now I'm alone in his office I

786
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:44,559
hardly sit down and he says we're going

787
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,120
for a

788
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:51,120
walk and I said where are we going and

789
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,840
he says we're going to

790
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,919
see the

791
00:33:52,840 --> 00:34:00,279
man who was Sam strum

792
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,320
one of your investors one of the

793
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:05,159
investors we walk across the street to

794
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:09,000
the reineer tower the Old rineer Tower I

795
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:12,280
think Sam had one of the biggest offices

796
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:15,119
we walk in there and I swear even though

797
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:18,960
it's so many years later I have a

798
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:22,359
perfect Vivid account for what took

799
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,440
place Sam is sitting behind his desk and

800
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,480
this is what happened because it was 5

801
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,000
minutes Bill

802
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,240
Gates remember remember he's a huge guy

803
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:37,200
leans over to the desk with his hands on

804
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:40,240
Sam's desk and says I don't know what

805
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,159
you are planning but whatever it is it's

806
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,520
not going to

807
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:48,520
happen wow and he says Howard Schultz is

808
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,520
going to acquire Starbucks coffee

809
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,200
company and he's never going to hear

810
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,200
from you

811
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:58,680
again that was

812
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,880
it and we walk out

813
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,040
out that's it that's the whole thing and

814
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,000
so did you hear from Jerry that the bid

815
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,400

816
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,119

business background how did he become

834
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,359

835
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,480
real estate and also in those auto

836
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:56,599

837
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,920
joural cap table like wasn't he an

838
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:01,200
investor still he he was he and his

839
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,800

840
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,960
they got out oh wow wow till they got

841
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:07,960
out wow Looking Back Now what do you

842
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:09,920
think happened did he have any

843
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,520
legitimate criticisms of you as running

844
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:14,960
the company no he had he had a henchman

845
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:16,640
who was his money guy who figured out we

846
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,560
we could just take this company and what

847
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,640
do we need Howard Schultz for who is

848
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,240
this young

849
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:25,040
kid and he and Sam had experience with

850
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,680
retail with those auto stores I see so

851
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,440
he could install some Professional

852
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:31,119
Management from Venture run the Playbook

853
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,280
yeah it would have been over but the

854
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,839
thing about Bill Gates is I saw him

855
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,000
socially a 100 plus

856
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:44,880
times he never ever said anything public

857
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,720
about what he did he never took credit

858
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:49,640
for it so for listeners uh Howard's told

859
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,599
this elsewhere but you spoke at the

860
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:54,560
Microsoft CEO Summit you recounted the

861
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,640
story to you know the Fortune 500 CEOs

862
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:59,160
and um Bill Gates III you know Microsoft

863
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,960
founder comes up to you afterwards and

864
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:04,440
says um yeah who was the guy but Bill

865
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:06,880
did not know the whole story he didn't

866
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:08,720
know any of it he didn't know what his

867
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,960
father had done for me he's hearing it

868
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,319
for the first time and this is you know

869
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:15,520
2015 or something so Starbucks like you

870
00:37:13,319 --> 00:37:17,560
would think no he didn't know someone

871
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,560
would want to tell their family I played

872
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,200
some significant role in this but that's

873
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,760
not the type of guy he was Bill Gates

874
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:25,720
Senor never told us Soul what he did for

875
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:27,880
me wow again

876
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:31,520
humility incredible lesson about

877
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:33,880
humility it's amazing yeah and so were

878
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,880
Bill Gates Senior and Bill Gates II

879
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:37,720
investors in that 3.8 Million Dollar

880
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,599
Round Bill senior was but I don't know

881
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,839
if it was part of Bill or yeah Microsoft

882
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:45,240
in interesting um so I asked Sherry

883
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,359
about this When I Was preparing for the

884
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,480
episode and her recollection was it was

885
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:52,280
something

886
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,599
like one to two weeks before the 3month

887
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:56,880
exclusivity for you was going to be up

888
00:37:54,599 --> 00:37:58,240
and so you're basically like this event

889
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,160
happens but now you need to come up with

890
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,040
the money and you have this unbelievably

891
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,720
short period of time to do so and so she

892
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,720
said that you were calling everybody you

893
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,880
knew she was calling her clients cuz

894
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:11,720
she's a designer calling her clients

895
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,160
trying to just you know find pockets of

896
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:17,280
50k here 100K there anywhere you could

897
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,079
to make it happen but I had another

898
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:23,200
Angel who helped me by the name of Jack

899
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,240
Rogers who became a lifelong friend who

900
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,520
passed away a couple years ago he was

901
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,040
part of an investor group and he brought

902
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:35,200
them along so the acquisition goes

903
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:38,520
through yeah August of ' 87 yeah we

904
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:41,160
bought the six Starbucks stores we had

905
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:43,240
the three old ill jali and there were

906
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,079
two stores under construction so at the

907
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:49,720
end of the calendar year we had 11

908
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:54,400
stores and 100 employees in

909
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:56,000
1987 all in the Northwest yeah meanwhile

910
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,720
the original Starbucks folks they've now

911
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,839
gone down to cnia went to California

912
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:04,560
when did Pete's open coffee bars uh many

913
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:07,119
many years later ah so they you weren't

914
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,000
competing away no but this is one of the

915
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,960
great observations David ill joural buys

916
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:14,240
the Starbucks stores rebrands ill joural

917
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,000
incorporated as the Starbucks

918
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:19,880
Corporation yeah and the original

919
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,440
Starbucks buys you know had owned pets

920
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,079
and now needs a new name so it rebrands

921
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,800
the company pets so pets was actually

922
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:28,000
Starbucks Starbucks was actually ilj yes

923
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,480
it's amazing

924
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,319
some stats just for listeners to

925
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:34,760
understand the gravity of the situation

926
00:39:32,319 --> 00:39:37,680
uh for the initial 1.6 million that you

927
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:41,400
raised for ill joural you talked to 242

928
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,960
investors 2117 of which said no so

929
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,920
anybody who's griping about their

930
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:47,280
fundraising journey and you know those

931
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:48,839
are rookie numbers get but you asked me

932
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,680
a question earlier about what did the

933
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:56,000
years at Xerox teach me so the rejection

934
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:58,599
I was going through the Italians turned

935
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,440
me down people the US turn me down

936
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:04,040
nobody would believe in the idea it was

937
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,000
like I was Co calling again at Xerox the

938
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:08,960
other thing that is worth pointing out

939
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:11,319
is the

940
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:13,720
Starbucks company with the six stores

941
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,160
when they bought pets with that six to1

942
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:17,880
debt to equity ratio basically backed

943
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,440
themselves into a corner where now they

944
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:22,599
had these big Debt Service payments to

945
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:25,319
make there was really no risk they could

946
00:40:22,599 --> 00:40:27,319
take or innovation that they could do

947
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:29,079
because the whole business needed to

948
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:31,359
spit out a certain amount of cash every

949
00:40:29,079 --> 00:40:33,920
month so they could pay down the debt

950
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:36,680
and so when you're in that situation

951
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,480
Starbucks in the 40 years ahead from

952
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:41,119
this point in the story has tried all

953
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,960
sorts of crazy things to become the

954
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:46,560
business that it is today and when you

955
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:48,720
first created this combined company you

956
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,920
were pretty religious about no debt no

957
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,480
debt I I want any debt again because of

958
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:55,520
my childood I was going to ask you was

959
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:57,720
that informed by the the what you had

960
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:00,280
seen with the Starbucks situation your

961
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:02,079
child no it it's total my childhood my

962
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:05,440
parents were always in debt bill

963
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,319
collectors were always calling and uh no

964
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,760
there was we never had any debt the

965
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:13,079
entire time never this is probably a

966
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,119
good point in time to talk about the

967
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:17,280
business model a little bit you've

968
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,040
alluded to kind of a stigma at least

969
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:20,599
among potential investors and the

970
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:22,800
original Starbucks founders of like the

971
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:24,359
restaurant business what did the

972
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,040
economics of the business of the coffee

973
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:30,440
bar business look like when you bought

974
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:33,640
the Starbucks stores so what did we buy

975
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:35,640
we had the stores we had the brand name

976
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:39,240
and we had a roasting facility on

977
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:41,240
Airport Way in Seattle the ability to

978
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:45,119
source and roast

979
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:48,800
coffee and put that through the supply

980
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,720
chain of a beverage gave us probably at

981
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,040
the time an 80% gross margin wow yeah

982
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,280
that is not the the quote unquote

983
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:58,280
restaurant business that people are

984
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,359
imagining and I could begin to see even

985
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:05,000
early on the creative nature of

986
00:42:02,359 --> 00:42:07,720
frequency where I can see what was going

987
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:09,480
on here is people were not coming for

988
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:11,680
coffee in the morning anymore they were

989
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:14,400
starting the morning Rush was getting

990
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,720
bigger the need for more labor and I

991
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,960
could sense that the business that

992
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,720
Starbucks was in was going to be

993
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:25,559
significantly in the back and the

994
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,359
beverage and the Romance of the theater

995
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:31,839
and the third place was the hero

996
00:42:28,359 --> 00:42:33,960
didn't take us long to realize we had

997
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,119
the beginning of lightning in the bottle

998
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:38,280
even the best most successful restaurant

999
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,760
you could possibly imagine how many

1000
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,000
times are their most loyal customers

1001
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:45,599
going to come there in a week yeah well

1002
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,400
there were I think there was a time in

1003
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,520
the Northwest when we were really at our

1004
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,319
Peak where the average customer was

1005
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:53,920
coming 18 times a month I should

1006
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,000
rephrase it maybe the most loyal was

1007
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:58,760
coming 18 times a month there's some

1008
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:01,040
magic to this idea that it's not a

1009
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:02,520
terribly expensive item I think I saw

1010
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,760
some research that said that it's you

1011
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:07,079
know sub 1% of someone's house household

1012
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:09,640
income and often far less than that but

1013
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:10,720
it is repeat and it is high gross margin

1014
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:12,119
and so when you say lightning in a

1015
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:13,720
bottle there's a cultural lightning in a

1016
00:43:12,119 --> 00:43:17,200
bottle but there's also this like

1017
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:19,800
ridiculous business model where the way

1018
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,359
it shows up is your stores basically

1019
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,720
from this point forward for all of

1020
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:25,440
Starbucks's life you'd build a new store

1021
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:27,160
and the profits from that store would

1022
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,480
totally cover the cost within 2 years

1023
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,760
years and often a year and a half but

1024
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:34,280
I'll tell you the economic model that we

1025
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,400
we applied to every single store we were

1026
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,119
opening you know by the way I chose the

1027
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,359
first 500 locations myself so I was in

1028
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,839
it in so many ways but the the economic

1029
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:47,720
model in Wall Street when we went public

1030
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:49,640
in '92 now I'm just when they when they

1031
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:51,400
heard the model said well we never seen

1032
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,440
a model like that and the model

1033
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,359
basically was a sales to investment

1034
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:59,040
ratio of

1035
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:00,359
2:1 and a operating profit of 20% so

1036
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,359
what does that mean sales to investment

1037
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:05,440
ratio so if the sales were a million

1038
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:07,040
dollars the investment was 500,000 met

1039
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,520
just the sales to invest had to be a two

1040
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,680
to one wow in year one of operation yes

1041
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:13,119
and the and and the the operating profit

1042
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:16,440
was was north of

1043
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:17,880
20% wow but cash on cast return was so

1044
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:20,000
yeah you get that two years or last

1045
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:21,640
payback the retail world had never seen

1046
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,680
a model like this before there was no

1047
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,200
physical storefront that could had this

1048
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:28,680
business model before this early on it

1049
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,559
became clear to that customers were also

1050
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:31,280
starting to customize the beverage on

1051
00:44:30,559 --> 00:44:35,800
their

1052
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,880
own so we were just Bria was behind a

1053
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,599
counter and somebody would say can I can

1054
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:42,359
you put something else in there yeah

1055
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,960
what do you want and then so that just

1056
00:44:42,359 --> 00:44:46,440
started you know the average ticket

1057
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,319
started growing as a result of the

1058
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:51,079
customers personalizing and customizing

1059
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,599
their beverage and to be clear like the

1060
00:44:51,079 --> 00:44:56,240
era of Starbucks we are in right now you

1061
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,319
produce drip coffee and you produce es

1062
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:00,200
espresso you can put that espresso in

1063
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:02,359
frothed milk and those that's basically

1064
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,880
your options yeah like none of this you

1065
00:45:02,359 --> 00:45:08,040
know yeah exactly but can I tell you a

1066
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:11,240
mistake I made please please when ilali

1067
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:13,680
was getting ready to open the standard

1068
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:16,760
cup in the world was that terrible

1069
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,079
Styrofoam cup that is used in diners in

1070
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:23,119
New York City remember that cup yeah I

1071
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:25,079
put boiling water into that cup five

1072
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:27,640
minutes later the cup is starting to

1073
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:29,440
turn like a golden color because of the

1074
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,800
chemical that can't be good for your

1075
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:34,599
insides or the taste of the

1076
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,920
cough and so we had to find we had to

1077
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:40,559
change the cup this was such a smart

1078
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:44,319
move in retrospect but we were just

1079
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:47,720
trying to figure out now no one in

1080
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:51,000
America that is in the paper business

1081
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:53,880
had any kind of cup or lid that was

1082
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:55,680
compatible with what I was trying to do

1083
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:57,800
in fact they didn't understand it why

1084
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,599
not just use the cup that exist is no

1085
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:01,559
because it doesn't taste good and it

1086
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:04,000
doesn't feel right right why go to the

1087
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,680
trouble of you know this perfected roast

1088
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,400
of these beautifully source to rabika

1089
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:09,240
beans from all these Farmers if you're

1090
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:10,960
going to pour it into styrofoam yeah

1091
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:13,200
okay people think you were a hippie like

1092
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,160
when you were tell these like are you

1093
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,480
this dismiss me

1094
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:21,000
so we went to Chicago to the

1095
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,559
International Paper company and they had

1096
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:25,920
a

1097
00:46:22,559 --> 00:46:30,079
cup but the cup didn't have a

1098
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:33,680
lid a compatible lid and so we found

1099
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:36,440
they found a lid that beautiful sip lid

1100
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:38,400
which is now ubiquitous in the world

1101
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:41,119
Howard SCH should have said to them I

1102
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,960
want an exclusive on that

1103
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:46,160
lid because that lid became the standard

1104
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:47,920
for the world if I would have just

1105
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:50,280
understood that the other thing I didn't

1106
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,680
do is we introduced cafe latte to the to

1107
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:54,400
America we didn't trademark it you know

1108
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:57,240
we trademarked Frappuccino later on but

1109
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:59,400
we didn't trademark cafe latte this you

1110
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,440
know wasn't thinking yeah you got enough

1111
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,839
right you don't need to get them all

1112
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,520
right no I I just I missed it when uh

1113
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,880
the

1114
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:10,480
sizing Grande ventti oh that was a the

1115
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:12,920
hidden Traina yeah right when did that

1116
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,760
start there was a brilliant brilliant

1117
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,319
guy who was the architect of the name

1118
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,480
Starbucks named Terry Heckler in Seattle

1119
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,200
and he's a fantastic design guy and

1120
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,960
we're just sitting one day and I just

1121
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,040
talking about the importance of language

1122
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:32,760
we got to get the language right we got

1123
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:35,599
the cup got to get the language and we

1124
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:38,359
just started talking about changing it

1125
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:41,720
from The Pedestrian words of small

1126
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:43,880
medium large to what it became which was

1127
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:46,119
short tall and

1128
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:48,119
Grande people made fun of it but they

1129
00:47:46,119 --> 00:47:49,480
loved it was ventti not an original

1130
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,960
ventti we didn't have that size when we

1131
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:53,359
started that was later on Wow who who

1132
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:55,440
would have thought somebody wanted to

1133
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:58,800
this is America yeah this is

1134
00:47:55,440 --> 00:48:01,119
America so my one more question on this

1135
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:03,880
writing the customer's name on the cup

1136
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,960
that didn't come from me as the stores

1137
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:08,920
got busier and busier the bries were

1138
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:11,720
having a hard time with whose cup is it

1139
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,000
what are we going to do and someone at

1140
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:16,720
Starbucks I don't know who was started

1141
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:19,880
writing names on the cup writing names

1142
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,760
and it just became

1143
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:25,920
standard so much of Starbucks success

1144
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:29,280
came from customers asking for things we

1145
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:31,880
weren't doing and Starbucks employees

1146
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:33,960
who became Partners in '

1147
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:36,240
91 understanding the business better

1148
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:37,800
than me and this is all like you know to

1149
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:40,240
my mind just starting to create this

1150
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:43,480
incredible flywheel right if you've got

1151
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,760
this 80% gross margin business where the

1152
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:49,440
key lever is repeat loyal customer

1153
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:51,520
visits you've got customization that is

1154
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,760
making customers more loyal and

1155
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:55,440
increasing your margin at the same time

1156
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,880
because you can charge more for it

1157
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,839
you've got the interpers relationship

1158
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:03,920
with the Baristas sure but also even as

1159
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:05,760
you scale I mean the name on the cup

1160
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,200
that's something that scales even as

1161
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:09,760
thousands and thousands of people come

1162
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:12,079
into the store the intimacy with the

1163
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:14,839
customer and the Bree became a very

1164
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:18,160
powerful component of the equity of the

1165
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:21,640
experience and I've always thought in so

1166
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:23,480
many ways Starbucks became the first

1167
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:25,400
experiential

1168
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:28,280
brand at

1169
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,920
scale we spend any money on marketing

1170
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:33,960
zero there was no money for marketing

1171
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:37,440
and the cup the iconic cup became a

1172
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:40,799
badge of honor because people were doing

1173
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,440
something that was new and novel and

1174
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,079
walking in the street with it and people

1175
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:45,400
you know what is that there a lot of

1176
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:47,280
that kind of stuff it's your free

1177
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,839
billboard yeah that people are proud of

1178
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:52,920
perfect wow well listeners this entire

1179
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:54,839
episode so far we have broadly been

1180
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:57,240
talking about the concept of customer

1181
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:58,839
experience with Howard and we want to

1182
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,319
talk about another business that has

1183
00:49:58,839 --> 00:50:03,200
been innovating on the customer

1184
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:05,160
experience and that's JP Morgan payments

1185
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,760
when it comes to digital Commerce JP

1186
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,040
Morgan payments is all about

1187
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:11,799
personalization and convenience both for

1188
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,359
consumers and businesses right so on the

1189
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:16,359
consumer side technology has completely

1190
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:18,520
changed expectations for shopping and

1191
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:20,760
commerce whether it's a sneaker drop or

1192
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:22,559
a coffee order customers expect

1193
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,240
functionality like ordering in an app

1194
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,880
but picking up in store getting

1195
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:27,920
real-time updates and having our

1196
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:30,520
preferences and past orders synced and

1197
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:32,520
remembered yep and importantly we expect

1198
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:34,799
our payments to be simple no matter

1199
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:36,880
where or how we want to pay which

1200
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:38,960
creates real challenges for the business

1201
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:41,040
on the other side of that to create the

1202
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,440
magic even with super complex

1203
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:45,440
transactions like a Marketplace website

1204
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:47,760
where you aren't just buying from one

1205
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,920
single retailer but a merchant on the

1206
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,000
other side of that platform you can

1207
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,799
imagine there are plenty of Technical

1208
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,760
and Regulatory complexities to make that

1209
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:57,160
frictionless across different countries

1210
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,640
and currencies but with with great

1211
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,520
embedded finance and Innovative Commerce

1212
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,599
Solutions you can Delight customers

1213
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,119
without really taking that all on

1214
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,040
yourself yep no matter how big or small

1215
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,160
your company is you have to manage a

1216
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:12,680
complex technology ecosystem that now

1217
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:15,200
includes online payments inapp payments

1218
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:17,440
social payments inore payments digital

1219
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,559
wallets and much more in the future oh

1220
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,720
yes like biometric payments which

1221
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:25,680
remarkably research shows that will

1222
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:29,280
reach 3 billion users and $ 5.8 trillion

1223
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,280
in value globally by 2026 that is insane

1224
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:33,960
yep and just like Howard pioneered many

1225
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:36,160
firsts in his industry JP Morgan is

1226
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:39,000
doing the same with biometric payments

1227
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,040
it's essentially a pay byf face solution

1228
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:43,400
that allows you to complete transactions

1229
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:45,160
seamlessly and securely removing the

1230
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:47,200
need for carrying a wallet or digging

1231
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,040
into your bag to pull out your phone

1232
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,920
yeah if any of you were at the Formula 1

1233
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:53,119
race in Miami last month you may have

1234
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:55,400
even seen JP Morgan's biometric payments

1235
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:57,280
powering the fast lane checkouts in the

1236
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,760
merch store in last Year's pilot

1237
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:01,960
literally every single payment was

1238
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,040
processed in under 1 second crazy and

1239
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,160
for businesses speed of payments is

1240
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,960
obviously great to shorten lines to

1241
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,599
quantify that biometric Payment

1242
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:12,200
Solutions have shown to decrease

1243
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:14,559
checkout times by up to 35 seconds per

1244
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:17,280
transaction and increase purchase value

1245
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:19,599
by 4% driving incremental revenue and

1246
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:21,359
maximizing profitability I can totally

1247
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,119
attest to this as a customer I basically

1248
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,599
only use tap to pay with my watch or

1249
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:27,720
phone everywhere I go now which you know

1250
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:29,520
just felt like sci-fi a few years ago

1251
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,240
but unsurprisingly that capability for

1252
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,359
merchants to accept contactless payments

1253
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,760
is now also being powered by JP Morgan

1254
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:37,359
payments yep so whether you want a full

1255

500 so in this era I mean you must just

1270
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:14,440
be getting more and more excited every

1271
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:17,440
day oh I was out of my mind so David

1272
00:53:14,440 --> 00:53:19,480
Howard sent me there's a 1988 I can't

1273
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:23,760
believe this was filmed but a

1274
00:53:19,480 --> 00:53:24,960
1988 shareholder and employee meeting

1275
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:27,040
where it's great the whole thing is like

1276
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,839
an hour and a half it's it's it's it's

1277
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:31,400
all there and you are using all the same

1278
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:33,480
language that you use today back in 1988

1279
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:35,400
we focus on our people those people

1280
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,280
Delight the customer the customer you

1281
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:41,119
know Delights the shareholder or then

1282
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:43,440
satisfies the shareholder and the

1283
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:45,720
conviction that you have it's like

1284
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:47,400
watching a preacher you're up there

1285
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,440
you've got I think 11 stores or

1286
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:54,079
something and you're like you have no

1287
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:55,680
idea what we have here we are on top of

1288
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,160
something that is going to change and

1289
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,040
you don't say the world

1290
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,000
America and this thing can become

1291
00:54:00,040 --> 00:54:04,680
America's Coffee House MH and it was

1292
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:07,359
interesting because I think the whole

1293
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,799
room was already scared of your ambition

1294
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,960
of you know going Nationwide with this

1295
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:14,559
thing that there did not exist another

1296
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:17,280
example of a National Coffee House chain

1297
00:54:14,559 --> 00:54:18,720
everything was just these little cities

1298
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,880
these small markets and there's this

1299
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:22,920
great quote that you have at the end of

1300
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:25,680
the meeting that says the company since

1301
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:26,880
1971 has been growing at a very very

1302
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:29,319
slow pace

1303
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:30,920
as a result of that you combine ilal and

1304
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:32,839
Starbucks together we're going to take

1305
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:34,839
your six stores that you've built in 17

1306
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:36,480
years and we're going to go to 26 in one

1307
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:39,280
year and we're going to go to over a

1308
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:41,400
hundred in five years and that must have

1309
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:42,799
just sounded Bonkers but that is

1310
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:45,119
literally what happened that's what

1311
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:47,240
happened like the pace of growth

1312
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:50,040
approximately you just doubled stores

1313
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:53,520
year over year over year was there some

1314
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,079
moment in 88 ' 89 90 where you're just

1315
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:59,200
like looking around

1316
00:54:55,079 --> 00:55:01,640
realizing we must expand as fast as we

1317
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,000
possibly can because this concept is the

1318
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:06,440
concept the world needs now and if we

1319
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:08,520
don't pull out all the stops someone

1320
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,680
else is going to do it there were

1321
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:14,640
Regional competitors who were making

1322
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,799
noise about doing what we were aspiring

1323
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:20,680
to do and I was very mindful because one

1324
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:23,559
of them was franchising and that was

1325
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:25,000
Gloria Jeans out of Chicago and at one

1326
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:27,200
point I think they had more stores than

1327
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:28,799
we did because of the franch Fring

1328
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,039
opportunity and that's one of the

1329
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:34,400
reasons why I went to Chicago as well in

1330
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:36,280
' 8788 cuz Chicago was the first Market

1331
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,039
outside of Seattle and Vancouver right

1332
00:55:36,280 --> 00:55:42,400
even before LA and it didn't work right

1333
00:55:38,039 --> 00:55:47,119
away huh Howard bear should be credited

1334
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:49,799
with so much of the cultural texture and

1335
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,880
the tapestry of the humanity of the

1336
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:57,440
company said I will go to Chicago and

1337
00:55:52,880 --> 00:56:00,640
fix it he went to Chicago and stayed in

1338
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,599
Chicago through the winter and

1339
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,359
re-calibrated the mistakes we were

1340
00:56:02,599 --> 00:56:07,880
making and of course he and Orin were so

1341
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:11,079
instrumental

1342
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:14,520
into the loneliness that exists as a

1343
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:17,480
entrepreneur and their ability to help

1344
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:18,920
me build the company that you know today

1345
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:21,720
yeah so I have in my script here this is

1346
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:23,400
literally labeled the uh H2O era and

1347
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,559
yeah for anyone who was a partner at

1348
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:25,880
Starbucks sort of knows what I'm talking

1349
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:27,280
about and anybody else outside has no

1350
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:28,880
idea but there's two Howards there's

1351
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,119
Howard Schultz and Howard bear and

1352
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,760
Howard beard joined in 1989 Orin Smith

1353
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:34,960
joined in 1990 and the way that it looks

1354
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,839
to me from the outside and you can tell

1355
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:40,400
me if this is right you were sort of the

1356
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:42,920
vision and ambition that would almost

1357
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,559
like take any ambition that anybody else

1358
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:47,960
had and forced them to think bigger and

1359
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,000
faster okay and then Howard bear was in

1360
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:51,680
many ways the soul like he brought the

1361
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:54,599
idea of servant leadership he brought

1362
00:56:51,680 --> 00:56:56,400
the idea of nothing else matters if we

1363
00:56:54,599 --> 00:56:58,799
aren't people first and obviously that

1364
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:00,400
became a huge tenant of Starbucks as we

1365
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:02,680
knew it through the '90s and 2000s but

1366
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:06,599
that seems like it really arrived with

1367
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:09,079
him and then Orin is like a numbers God

1368
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:13,000
no he was the adult in the room more

1369
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:15,960
than the numbers he had the style he was

1370
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:18,760
quiet he was a gentleman he was the only

1371
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:21,200
MBA in the company but he was the wise

1372
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,119
man who behind a doors could say to me

1373
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:27,319
and Howard you're both full of

1374
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:29,200
we're not doing that H and we listened

1375
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:31,599
more or

1376
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:33,680
less and is it true that the three of

1377
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:37,119
you had uh dinner every Monday night for

1378
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:39,119
a decade more or less that is true

1379
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:41,680
sometimes more than once if we had a

1380
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:42,599
crisis or two which generally we did or

1381
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:45,079
we had a

1382
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:48,599
disagreement there's a lot of creative

1383
00:57:45,079 --> 00:57:50,599
conflict especially between Howard and I

1384
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,520
because he had a operate what we were

1385
00:57:50,599 --> 00:57:55,599
trying to do and at times he thought we

1386
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:56,839
were growing too fast or head of the

1387
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,599
resources

1388
00:57:56,839 --> 00:58:02,319
H because he was basically training all

1389
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,880
these operators the the the sort of

1390
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,839
management Fleet of the company yeah he

1391
00:58:03,880 --> 00:58:08,119
was building the operating system for us

1392
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:11,119
to be able to open the store design the

1393
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:13,559
stores which more or less I had done

1394
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:15,920
build them operate them train them and

1395
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:18,720
create the system to handle the flow of

1396
00:58:15,920 --> 00:58:21,240
customers so he had his job was much

1397
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:22,799
harder than mine speaking of system what

1398
00:58:21,240 --> 00:58:26,200
did your technology look like at this

1399
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:27,920
point oh don't embarrass him no we had

1400
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:30,880
was no there was no

1401
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:34,240
technology no were you running like a

1402
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:35,760
Oracle system not at that time no wow no

1403
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:38,720
we're talking paper yeah it was mostly

1404
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:40,280
manual wow yeah I mean the eventually

1405
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:42,760
when they did get point of sale

1406
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:45,160
terminals they were dos based all the

1407
00:58:42,760 --> 00:58:47,520
way through like 2008 right yes yes like

1408
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:49,880
the iPhone was out and you guys had dos

1409
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,480
based Point of Sales Systems sounds

1410
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:54,839
right but obviously technology was not

1411
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:57,960
the secret I'm foreshadowing here of the

1412
00:58:54,839 --> 00:59:00,880
future of the company yeah so let's take

1413
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:02,839
it forward from this 88 89 90 the first

1414
00:59:00,880 --> 00:59:04,760
market after Chicago after you sort of

1415
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:07,240
wred that ship that you decide to enter

1416
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:09,240
on the west coast is La that's the big

1417
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:11,400
fight between Howard and I I don't think

1418
00:59:09,240 --> 00:59:13,599
I realize it was a big fight I just felt

1419
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:16,480
in my bones we had to go to to

1420
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,720
LA and and he said we're not ready for

1421
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:22,720
La we're going to San Diego I said San

1422
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:24,319
Diego Tri who's in San Diego no we're

1423
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:25,559
not going to San Diego we're going to La

1424
00:59:24,319 --> 00:59:26,599
and I've got the location you want to

1425
00:59:25,559 --> 00:59:29,240
play in the MJ

1426
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:33,839
yeah so we had a meeting about it and it

1427
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:39,440
it it erupted erupted into

1428
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:42,280
a bad a bad scene and uh one thing led

1429
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,280
to another we we did go to La I'm

1430
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:48,280
shocked we did go to La it was fine and

1431
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,559
your conviction of we have to go to La

1432
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:53,680
was that for I the equity of the brand I

1433
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:55,839
could see I could Envision the warm

1434
00:59:53,680 --> 00:59:57,760
weather and everyone walking around with

1435
00:59:55,839 --> 01:00:00,559
our cups and the media and the

1436
00:59:57,760 --> 01:00:02,559
celebrities and just the iconic way and

1437
01:00:00,559 --> 01:00:05,839
there was nothing in the market nothing

1438
01:00:02,559 --> 01:00:07,839
at all that even appeared to be in the

1439
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:10,240
business that we were in and anyone who

1440
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:12,839
was doing it was not doing it well we

1441
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,680
had to go and even though we maybe were

1442
01:00:12,839 --> 01:00:17,839
not ready we just had to do it and we

1443
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,839
did and I think Howard would agree today

1444
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:21,760
that that ended up being a the right

1445
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:26,359
decision and

1446
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:29,960
La the Halo on Starbucks from Seattle

1447
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:32,039
the Vancouver and Chicago was nothing

1448
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:35,520
when we went to LA it just

1449
01:00:32,039 --> 01:00:37,920
exploded because celebrities Embrace

1450
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:41,599
Starbucks was there an intentional

1451
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:43,520
strategy to uh create sort of a luxury

1452
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:45,119
brand out of Starbucks that like the

1453
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,039
cool people were carrying the Starbucks

1454
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:50,079
cup it might be a little bit expensive

1455
01:00:47,039 --> 01:00:51,960
but you can afford it no there was no I

1456
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,440
can never remember a

1457
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:56,200
discussion about segmentation of the

1458
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:58,359
brand

1459
01:00:56,200 --> 01:01:01,480
because we we wanted Starbucks to be

1460
01:00:58,359 --> 01:01:04,559
accessible to all you'd have a CEO of a

1461
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:07,640
company and the person behind them was a

1462
01:01:04,559 --> 01:01:09,280
bluecollar truck driver because everyone

1463
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:11,440
could afford the affordable luxury of

1464
01:01:09,280 --> 01:01:14,000
Starbucks at the time when you say

1465
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:17,160
affordable luxury what about it was

1466
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:20,039
luxury the quality of the coffee MH The

1467
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:21,920
Experience MH and what it felt like to

1468
01:01:20,039 --> 01:01:24,280
walk around with that cup at the

1469
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:26,880
time it was a

1470
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:29,839
badge it was like you were in the

1471
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:34,079
know yeah it wasn't a badge of luxury it

1472
01:01:29,839 --> 01:01:36,559
was just like something new so it became

1473
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:39,359
a Trope for decades now that you know

1474
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,559
it's oh it's a $6 latte or an $8 latte

1475
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:45,760
or 10 where does that come from in your

1476
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:48,359
mind is Starbucks premium priced is

1477
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,559
there actually a Starbucks gets to

1478
01:01:48,359 --> 01:01:52,720
charge a little bit more because the

1479
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:56,119
brand has more cache or is that just

1480
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:58,160
completely a farce or myth I think the

1481
01:01:56,119 --> 01:02:02,240
pricing of

1482
01:01:58,160 --> 01:02:05,480
Starbucks was directly linked to the

1483
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:09,880
economic model that I alluded to

1484
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:13,200
earlier and the rising cost of Labor

1485
01:02:09,880 --> 01:02:15,520
rent and the fiduciary responsibility

1486
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:17,880
that we all felt to

1487
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:19,680
achieving the promise we had to our

1488
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:21,240
shareholders and now we're talking about

1489
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,760
as a public

1490
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:25,319
company there certainly was a fair

1491
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:29,359
amount of discussion all the time about

1492
01:02:25,319 --> 01:02:32,240
the sensitiv ity of the price points and

1493
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:34,559
I think in later years maybe in the last

1494
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:38,319
couple years given the consumer

1495
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:43,119
inflationary time I think it's become a

1496
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:46,920
bit of a of a problem and

1497
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:49,520
certainly I've always said as Starbucks

1498
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:52,880
was growing that the ubiquity of

1499
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:55,440
Starbucks was an enemy to the company

1500
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:58,000
and the challenge was we have to figure

1501
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:00,079
out a way way to ensure the fact that we

1502
01:02:58,000 --> 01:03:02,640
are getting smaller as we're getting

1503
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:05,359
bigger and specifically how do we

1504
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:08,319
maintain intimacy and the currency of

1505
01:03:05,359 --> 01:03:12,160
trust with our customers and our people

1506
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:15,319
that unto itself is kind of the capsule

1507
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:18,680
of making sure that the growth doesn't

1508
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:21,680
become so intoxicating and so seductive

1509
01:03:18,680 --> 01:03:23,359
that we lose sight of the really secret

1510
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:26,079
of the company which was the internal

1511
01:03:23,359 --> 01:03:27,400
culture and values which built the brand

1512
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,960
and built a relationship with the

1513
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:32,760
customer yeah can you tell us about the

1514
01:03:29,960 --> 01:03:36,160
people this is such a huge yeah pillar

1515
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:37,640
to our minds of building Starbucks again

1516
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:40,240
we started this conversation talking

1517
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:42,920
about childhood I really want to build a

1518
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:47,279
different kind of company and and how do

1519
01:03:42,920 --> 01:03:48,400
I do that in a way that provides respect

1520
01:03:47,279 --> 01:03:51,319
and

1521
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:54,599
dignity because I was so

1522
01:03:51,319 --> 01:03:58,920
imprinted with how my my father felt

1523
01:03:54,599 --> 01:04:00,599
disrespected valued and kind of vilified

1524
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:04,079
as a

1525
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:06,200
uneducated Blue Collar veteran working

1526
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:09,640
in a series of jobs that he just never

1527
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:12,400
made it and living through the

1528
01:04:09,640 --> 01:04:14,200
dysfunction of of a poor family always

1529
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,039
under pressure with

1530
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:20,119
money and

1531
01:04:16,039 --> 01:04:21,960
so I I wanted to kind of crack the code

1532
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:26,760
on how do we

1533
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:28,520
create benefits that would in a way

1534
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:30,640
uh take the company in Direction no

1535
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:33,520
one's ever been in before and so early

1536
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:35,520
on we started talking about exceeding

1537
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:37,319
the expectations of our people so they

1538
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:39,559
can exceed the expectations of the

1539
01:04:37,319 --> 01:04:41,880
customer and the first time we actually

1540
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:44,520
were able to manifest that was a year

1541
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:46,920
before the IPO and and that was an

1542
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:50,640
incredible struggle because I had on my

1543
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:52,200
board two Venture capitalists and I was

1544
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:54,359
proposing something that had never been

1545
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:56,440
done before and that was I wanted to

1546
01:04:54,359 --> 01:04:59,200
give equity in a form of stock options

1547
01:04:56,440 --> 01:05:00,440
to every single employee in the company

1548
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:02,359
and they just said what what are you

1549
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:05,440
talking about we're not doing that and

1550
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:07,559
so the fight became ultimately we gave

1551
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:09,319
14% of everyone's base pay in the form

1552
01:05:07,559 --> 01:05:11,839
of stock options at the end of the year

1553
01:05:09,319 --> 01:05:14,359
based on the strike price and I had to

1554
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:17,119
do it the year before the IPO had to so

1555
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:21,240
everyone wouldn't miss it and I think

1556
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:23,920
the the the turning point of the culture

1557
01:05:21,240 --> 01:05:26,240
of the company was the day we announced

1558
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:28,839
that and we became partners

1559
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:32,640
and to the credit of Craig Foley who was

1560
01:05:28,839 --> 01:05:34,200
the VC and Jamie Shannon they believed

1561
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:36,599
that performance would be enhanced

1562
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:39,119
attrition would be lowered and that the

1563
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:41,720
brand would just Elevate as a result of

1564
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:44,640
that and it was true completely true

1565
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:49,400
that was that that changed Starbucks for

1566
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:51,920
decades and along with some other events

1567
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,559
based on doing the right thing I mean

1568
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:57,400
the the healthcare for parttime workers

1569
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,880
so then you know Healthcare I think 25

1570
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,079
years before the Affordable Care Act

1571
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:02,520
what we did with company for health

1572
01:06:00,079 --> 01:06:04,559
insurance and that also I grew up in a

1573
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:08,920
family with no health

1574
01:06:04,559 --> 01:06:12,559
insurance and I saw what happened so all

1575
01:06:08,920 --> 01:06:14,160
of that is that Argin story of mine of

1576
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:16,760
uh and the tragedy is my father passed

1577
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:20,359
away and never saw what we're able to do

1578
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:22,520
do you want the stats on that initial

1579
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:25,119
Employee Stock Grant I love to hear it

1580
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:27,240
so the program was called beanock

1581
01:06:25,119 --> 01:06:31,279
listeners that uh great name Howard was

1582
01:06:27,240 --> 01:06:33,119
alluding to amazing name so in 1988 the

1583
01:06:31,279 --> 01:06:34,760
uh health benefits roll out even to

1584
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,520
part-time employees including gay

1585
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:38,960
couples in domestic Partnerships I

1586
01:06:36,520 --> 01:06:42,160
believe the first of its kind that was a

1587
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:44,960
33 store company at that point a few

1588
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:47,319
years later you had grown to 55 stores

1589
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:49,920
you did the LA expansion and then in

1590
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:52,240
1991 which is the year before the IPO

1591
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:54,599
bean stock happens equity in the form of

1592
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:56,400
stock options goes out to everyone

1593
01:06:54,599 --> 01:06:59,720
working 20 plus hours a week there were

1594
01:06:56,400 --> 01:07:01,559
1,300 employees at the time and uh I

1595
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:04,240
believe it was the first time in history

1596
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,319
that part-time employees were offered a

1597
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:10,440
program like this so those initial

1598
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:13,680
grants the strike price was $6 per share

1599
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:15,920
today as we speak the share price is $77

1600
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,000
but there have been six splits since

1601
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:22,480
then which comes out to a

1602
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,039
64x so that initial Grant has

1603
01:07:22,480 --> 01:07:26,799
800x since even the part-time employees

1604
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:29,680
and Bree were offered the opportunity to

1605
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:31,520
buy Starbucks stock yeah a lawyer I

1606
01:07:29,680 --> 01:07:34,520
think Scott Greenberg at the time came

1607
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:37,559
to me and said we can't do this unless

1608
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:41,039
we get approval from the SEC because we

1609
01:07:37,559 --> 01:07:43,400
were over 500 shareholders so you know

1610
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:46,200
we've studied um lots of amazing

1611
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:47,359
companies on this show who have lots and

1612
01:07:46,200 --> 01:07:49,559
lots of different business models but

1613
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:52,000
one thing that just kept striking us as

1614
01:07:49,559 --> 01:07:54,039
we were preparing for Starbucks are the

1615
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,039
similarities to your neighbor here in

1616
01:07:54,039 --> 01:07:59,119
the Northwest in Costco Costco right and

1617
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:02,200
how you treat your people

1618
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:04,240
specifically that's not by accident both

1619
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:06,000
from a uh it's the right thing to do

1620
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:08,920
perspective and the amazing business

1621
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:10,520
model benefit of the retaining employees

1622
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:13,119
I mean it's so expensive to train a new

1623
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:14,520
employee it's not expensive to keep an

1624
01:08:13,119 --> 01:08:15,880
existing employee and so you can just

1625
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:17,679
pay people more if you keep them for

1626
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,279
longer yeah you know you just basically

1627
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:21,640
have extra money lying around is what

1628
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:23,319
what uh Costco discovered there's so

1629
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:26,359
much about Starbucks to David's Point

1630
01:08:23,319 --> 01:08:29,000
that's similar to Costco did you ever

1631
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:30,759
speak with Jeff propman or Jim senagal

1632
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,880
or any of those guys about this concept

1633
01:08:30,759 --> 01:08:34,520
do you know the answer to that we don't

1634
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:38,000
know assume the answer to this but I

1635
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:40,719
don't know it first Jeff Brockman

1636
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:44,640
invested in Starbucks in the round to

1637
01:08:40,719 --> 01:08:46,679
buy Starbucks no way yeah he in that 87

1638
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:51,080
round that's when I met Jeff for the

1639
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:54,440
first time Jeff became a board member of

1640
01:08:51,080 --> 01:08:58,600
the early imprinting of starucks

1641
01:08:54,440 --> 01:09:00,880
andle clearly a mentor mentor of mine

1642
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:03,400
and then he introduced me to Jim synagog

1643
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:08,040
and so there were many moments of me

1644
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:12,199
sitting with Jeff and Jim including the

1645
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:15,719
huge decision to put Starbucks Coffee in

1646
01:09:12,199 --> 01:09:19,679
Costco which there was a Revolt inside

1647
01:09:15,719 --> 01:09:24,159
the halls of starucks saying no effing

1648
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:26,279
way wow and we did it and Jeff and Jim

1649
01:09:24,159 --> 01:09:29,560
took me to a par paring

1650
01:09:26,279 --> 01:09:30,560
lot in Kirkland when I said I don't know

1651
01:09:29,560 --> 01:09:33,600
if we can do this I don't know if I can

1652
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:36,080
sell it inside I don't know okay meet us

1653
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:38,239
on a Sunday morning whatever it was look

1654
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:41,759
at the cars these are your

1655
01:09:38,239 --> 01:09:46,000
customers in fact putting Starbucks in

1656
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:49,799
Costco we were able to measure directly

1657
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:52,759
the increase in volume in the stores on

1658
01:09:49,799 --> 01:09:56,480
the east side as a result of the

1659
01:09:52,759 --> 01:09:59,560
proximity to the Costco store you sold

1660
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,320
beans we sold beans in Costco and that

1661
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:04,480
brand awareness of I buy Starbucks beans

1662
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,239
at home meant that that group of people

1663
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:10,640
went to the stores because we introduced

1664
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:12,320
thousands of Beverage customers to

1665
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:14,760
Costco through the

1666
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:17,679
beans wow so Jeff and Jim were

1667
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:21,199
instrumental in so many things and and

1668
01:10:17,679 --> 01:10:24,640
were so kind to me as a young

1669
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:26,520
kid then we went Nationwide with Costco

1670
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:28,760
so this is a thing thing that I think

1671
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:31,480
many people don't realize now that

1672
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:34,679
Starbucks is ubiquitous we sort of

1673
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:39,440
forget about this time when it wasn't

1674
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:40,760
and where people had to find some way to

1675
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:42,600
experience Starbucks you know you only

1676
01:10:40,760 --> 01:10:44,719
get a few stores in each of these cities

1677
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:48,199
you're only in a few cities but there

1678
01:10:44,719 --> 01:10:50,040
are ways to scale brand awareness and so

1679
01:10:48,199 --> 01:10:53,000
you can do things like become the

1680
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:56,600
official coffee of United Airlines or

1681
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:58,520
you know be in uh Costco all over the US

1682
01:10:56,600 --> 01:11:00,000
you did this a number of times and I

1683
01:10:58,520 --> 01:11:02,080
feel like the rest of the world did not

1684
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:04,400
catch on to what you were doing was just

1685
01:11:02,080 --> 01:11:06,280
finding little Billboards everywhere

1686
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:08,760
where you could put the Starbucks logo

1687
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:11,400
and and sort of create that ubiquity

1688
01:11:08,760 --> 01:11:14,800
yeah if you thought the Costco Revolt

1689
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:16,480
was high you can imagine when I said we

1690
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,679
have an opportunity for United Airlines

1691
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:23,000
people thought that was absolutely

1692
01:11:18,679 --> 01:11:25,719
blasphemy don't do that and again the

1693
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,320
exposure and the opportunity to surprise

1694
01:11:25,719 --> 01:11:29,480
and Delight customers in places that

1695
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:31,880
they' never had anything close to good

1696
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:35,239
coffee all these things when you

1697
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:38,639
consider we didn't spend a dollar a

1698
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:40,600
dollar of marketing dollars ever and so

1699
01:11:38,639 --> 01:11:43,639
the the the reputation of the company

1700
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:46,320
was built basically Word of Mouth both

1701
01:11:43,639 --> 01:11:47,960
inside our stores and exactly right in

1702
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:50,840
places that we could surprise the

1703
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,000
customer and then we also started

1704
01:11:50,840 --> 01:11:55,719
putting Starbucks Coffee in grocery

1705
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:57,360
stores which was the other thing because

1706
01:11:55,719 --> 01:11:59,960
remember we were building a beverage

1707
01:11:57,360 --> 01:12:02,280
business right and we were then going

1708
01:11:59,960 --> 01:12:04,040
back to our Core Business in new

1709
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:05,920
channels of distribution it's like the

1710
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:07,679
ultimate goal is to capture those margin

1711
01:12:05,920 --> 01:12:09,320
dollars from selling cups of coffees in

1712
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:11,239
the stores that you operate but there's

1713
01:12:09,320 --> 01:12:12,679
all these other things you can do that

1714
01:12:11,239 --> 01:12:14,159
actually might spit off some profit

1715
01:12:12,679 --> 01:12:15,760
dollars but at the very least it's a

1716
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,040
break even way to do customer

1717
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:18,880
acquisition and brand building in the

1718
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:20,880
rest of the world I don't know what our

1719
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:23,800
cost of customer acquisition was back

1720
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:25,600
then but it was low well you also you

1721
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,440
weren't spending any money on marketing

1722
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,000
but United Airlines was paying you for

1723
01:12:27,440 --> 01:12:32,239
coffee I assume I don't know exactly how

1724
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:34,800
went down but yeah they're um I have to

1725
01:12:32,239 --> 01:12:36,560
assume the Barnes & Noble bar basically

1726
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:39,600
the same thing Barnes & Noble is a

1727
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:42,360
different deal I met Len Rio the founder

1728
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:44,880
of Barnes & Noble very interesting guy

1729
01:12:42,360 --> 01:12:46,560
very smart guy great Merchant and we

1730
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,080
just started talking he was from

1731
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:51,840
Brooklyn I was from Brooklyn we had a

1732
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:53,440
natural kind of relationship and I said

1733
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:56,000
what do you think about us opening

1734
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:57,679
Starbucks inside Barnes & Noble given

1735
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:00,600
you are the ultimate third place is what

1736
01:12:57,679 --> 01:13:03,400
we are and it just again became a

1737
01:13:00,600 --> 01:13:05,360
natural extension of our stores we have

1738
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:08,800
a fun uh piece of trivia that you may

1739
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:12,440
know uh related to Costco do you know

1740
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:15,600
where Jeff Bezos and Jim Sagal met for

1741
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:18,120
the first time sounds like in a Costco

1742
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:20,639
not in a Costco in the Starbucks in the

1743
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:23,159
Barnes & Noble in bellw did not know

1744
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:26,080
that and that you know led to so many

1745
01:13:23,159 --> 01:13:29,040
things Amazon Prime among them yeah not

1746
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:32,040
know that and I still am friendly with

1747
01:13:29,040 --> 01:13:34,920
Jim Sagal today I mean your companies

1748
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:36,320
rhyme in so many ways it's it's uh

1749
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:39,080
that's not surprising at

1750
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:41,320
all I want to talk a little bit um

1751
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,639
before we get to the IPO here about what

1752
01:13:41,320 --> 01:13:46,080
the strategy was when you expanded

1753
01:13:43,639 --> 01:13:48,320
Market by market did you try to sprinkle

1754
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,520
a few stores in and see did you try to

1755
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:54,120
move into a market with force and be the

1756
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:55,760
dominant Coffee House chain in that City

1757
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:58,000
uh and in particular it it could be

1758
01:13:55,760 --> 01:13:59,719
worth talking about Boston well Boston's

1759
01:13:58,000 --> 01:14:02,639
an anomaly because of the acquisition

1760
01:13:59,719 --> 01:14:05,440
but bear was so

1761
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:08,679
strident in not expanding to multiple

1762
01:14:05,440 --> 01:14:11,159
markets at once and he was 100% right

1763
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:14,800
and so we didn't we went to

1764
01:14:11,159 --> 01:14:17,480
Chicago went to LA and we stayed there

1765
01:14:14,800 --> 01:14:19,560
for quite a while went to Portland uh we

1766
01:14:17,480 --> 01:14:22,679
weren't ready for New York City in terms

1767
01:14:19,560 --> 01:14:25,639
of the issues there and but we were very

1768
01:14:22,679 --> 01:14:28,320
diligent you went to DC First Years

1769
01:14:25,639 --> 01:14:32,120
we were not expanding to multiple

1770
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:34,760
markets until we had enough evidence in

1771
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:36,639
the existing Market that we had success

1772
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,320
and we weren't going to compound the

1773
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,400
growth in another Market with problems

1774
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:42,560
that we're having in the existing one

1775
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:44,719
and I think that's all be her because he

1776
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:47,840
was he was the managing all the

1777
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:53,480
operations Boston was very different we

1778
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:56,239
had a very strong highquality competitor

1779
01:14:53,480 --> 01:15:00,199
called The Coffee Connection in Boston

1780
01:14:56,239 --> 01:15:02,520
with a owner operator in George how who

1781
01:15:00,199 --> 01:15:05,520
was not unlike Alfred Pete kind of a

1782
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:08,560
gospel of Coffee Culture on the east

1783
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:11,080
coast and we knew Boston was going to be

1784
01:15:08,560 --> 01:15:13,199
tough for Starbucks to enter we also had

1785
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:14,880
Dunkin Donuts there like a lot of the

1786
01:15:13,199 --> 01:15:18,080
good real estate was taken by the coffee

1787
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:21,440
prodction right yeah and so George and I

1788
01:15:18,080 --> 01:15:24,560
never saw eye to eye and but it was

1789
01:15:21,440 --> 01:15:26,120
clear that if we came to Boston in a

1790
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,800
sign ific way we were going to impact

1791
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:32,800
his business and uh I think to his

1792
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:35,800
credit he was willing to sell so Coffee

1793
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:38,159
Connection was the first acquisition and

1794
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:40,440
we we had to tread very lightly after

1795
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:43,600
the acquisition because of the loyalty

1796
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:45,280
and be careful with the name and and uh

1797
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:47,840
you know solicit George's help and

1798
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,199
advice and also we needed him to kind of

1799
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:53,199
validate for us what we were trying to

1800
01:15:50,199 --> 01:15:55,719
do and ultimately it ended up being a

1801
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,400
very good strategy well it seemed like I

1802
01:15:55,719 --> 01:16:00,960
think the numbers are it was uh it's a

1803
01:15:57,400 --> 01:16:03,159
little bit after IPO in 94 $23 million

1804
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,239
they had 23 locations and they were

1805
01:16:03,159 --> 01:16:07,719
doing 16 million a year in Revenue so if

1806
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:10,080
you just look at like the purchase I

1807
01:16:07,719 --> 01:16:11,520
think it was onetime sales I think or

1808
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,320
maybe a little over one time sales and

1809
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,120
the original Starbucks ironically enough

1810
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:16,400
was exactly at onetime sales right

1811
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,840
that's what you bought it from the the

1812
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:20,520
founders for if they had the lock on all

1813
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:22,679
the best real estate and they had burned

1814
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:24,080
all the capital figuring out you know

1815
01:16:22,679 --> 01:16:25,639
what stores we should be in what stores

1816
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:27,360
we shouldn't be in and then you just get

1817
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:30,040
to like move into that market for

1818
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,440
onetime sales you know 1.5 whatever it

1819
01:16:30,040 --> 01:16:34,239
is uh with all that already figured out

1820
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:36,120
that's that's pretty amazing it probably

1821
01:16:34,239 --> 01:16:37,639
seemed high at the time though I'm sure

1822
01:16:36,120 --> 01:16:39,600
it did well isn't that the thing about

1823
01:16:37,639 --> 01:16:41,080
valuations and uh they they always it

1824
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:42,960
always seemed like in the good old days

1825
01:16:41,080 --> 01:16:47,800
you know everything was undervalued and

1826
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:50,920
yeah okay let's talk about the IPO so it

1827
01:16:47,800 --> 01:16:52,520
seems like you knew the moment that you

1828
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:54,639
bought Starbucks from the

1829
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,360
founders uh this is going to be a public

1830
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:57,960
company

1831
01:16:55,360 --> 01:16:59,000
I thought so there was no I I think it

1832
01:16:57,960 --> 01:17:02,239
there

1833
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:04,600
was so much about being a public company

1834
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:06,639
that meant something to me personally

1835
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:10,159
that it validated the company it

1836
01:17:06,639 --> 01:17:14,440
validated me my own shame insecurity as

1837
01:17:10,159 --> 01:17:17,159
a kid so that was a I was I was a

1838
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:18,960
driving force all along certainly the

1839
01:17:17,159 --> 01:17:21,239
the year before with beanock is an

1840
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,639
indication what I was planning if

1841
01:17:21,239 --> 01:17:26,400
beanock was turned down I I would have I

1842
01:17:23,639 --> 01:17:28,800
I would have waited m I just had to that

1843
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:30,880
had to be done I think we only had a

1844
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:33,159
couple of quarters of profitability and

1845
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:36,080
I think we had about 130 stores and what

1846
01:17:33,159 --> 01:17:39,080
was the revenue at the time

1847
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:40,360
oh I don't remember exactly I know what

1848
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,000
the market cap was the day we went

1849
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:45,679
public I think it you you ended up doing

1850
01:17:43,000 --> 01:17:48,080
93 million that year but the the year

1851
01:17:45,679 --> 01:17:49,520
before you know was 50 million or

1852
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:51,560
something like that like you companies

1853
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:54,080
went public when they were smaller back

1854
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,600
then but well you were a small cap IPO

1855
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:57,600
yeah we were and you know we got turned

1856
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:59,600
down by Goldman Sachs you know that I

1857
01:17:57,600 --> 01:18:02,239
did not know that I couldn't believe it

1858
01:17:59,600 --> 01:18:04,719
I mean I just I wanted Goldman Sachs as

1859
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:07,800
as the I just you know they were

1860
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:09,360
the the patina on the prospectus to have

1861
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,520
Goldman Sachs it would be a very

1862
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:15,719
Starbucks thing for Goldman Sachs to be

1863
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:18,000
the the lead left well uh blank fine I

1864
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:20,239
had a good friend who who was a senior

1865
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:21,760
partner there who since passed away I

1866
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,480
thought I had it locked I mean it was

1867
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:27,199
just so many things about it New York

1868
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:29,159
everything thing and they said no you're

1869
01:18:27,199 --> 01:18:31,280
too small well the thing that Dan

1870
01:18:29,159 --> 01:18:33,639
Levitan told us years ago when we did a

1871
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:35,560
an episode on the Starbucks IPO was that

1872
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:37,280
uh you were really only considering

1873
01:18:35,560 --> 01:18:38,840
smaller Banks because it was going to be

1874
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:41,920
a smaller IPO well I was considering it

1875
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:45,440
because gold they told you had no choice

1876
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:47,040
had no choice and Brockman at the time

1877
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:49,840
was not a big fan of wor time schroer

1878
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:52,639
which was Dan levitan's thing and so

1879
01:18:49,840 --> 01:18:54,280
Alex Brown became the lead but I also

1880
01:18:52,639 --> 01:18:56,520
you know I had my own ego attached to

1881
01:18:54,280 --> 01:18:58,400
this I had so much fun on the you know

1882
01:18:56,520 --> 01:19:00,639
on the road show I I was just in my

1883
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:02,080
element you know I was looking up I was

1884
01:19:00,639 --> 01:19:03,600
trying to figure out you know your

1885
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:06,000
public comps at the time I think there

1886
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:07,880
were zero publicly traded coffee

1887
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:10,120
companies not Bean companies not

1888
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:11,679
retailers not Coffee House chains I mean

1889
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:14,639
truly unheard of so when you're going on

1890
01:19:11,679 --> 01:19:15,800
this road show I think people of course

1891
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:17,560
are mystified there's like there's

1892
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:19,080
literally no public companies like yours

1893
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:20,639
you know investor education problem

1894
01:19:19,080 --> 01:19:22,400
right yeah I think we had to take them

1895
01:19:20,639 --> 01:19:25,239
through everything we had the product

1896
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:26,560
there you know we we served coffee

1897
01:19:25,239 --> 01:19:28,040
I you know gave him the whole show we

1898
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:30,880
had a short video that was probably in

1899
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:32,719
black and white the comp always was a

1900
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,199
restaurant and I was always fighting

1901
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:37,480
we're not a restaurant we're a hybrid

1902
01:19:35,199 --> 01:19:40,679
retailer I never referred to us as a

1903
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:42,760
cafe it was always a store we are a

1904
01:19:40,679 --> 01:19:45,639
store we are

1905
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:48,239
Merchants fascinating I mean I go there

1906
01:19:45,639 --> 01:19:50,560
and eat many many meals sitting in your

1907
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:52,159
store yeah but as we've been talking

1908
01:19:50,560 --> 01:19:54,880
about the economics you were a store we

1909
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:55,920
were a store we were a retail store so

1910
01:19:54,880 --> 01:19:57,760
Howard I'm going to take us through the

1911
01:19:55,920 --> 01:20:00,440
IPO uh you know you're the first

1912
01:19:57,760 --> 01:20:02,719
publicly traded Coffee Company uh you do

1913
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:04,280
end up doing 93 million in in Revenue

1914
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,800
that year do you remember the the exact

1915
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:10,280
price IP at yes I me we were we went out

1916
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:12,400
at $17 and the price was 21 the market

1917
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:14,960
cap I think was $250

1918
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,360
million can you imagine today a $250

1919
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:18,719
million market cap company going public

1920
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:20,760
and people considering that a success I

1921
01:20:18,719 --> 01:20:23,000
mean this is a great at the time for

1922
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:25,199
your employees how crazy is that what 12

1923
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,679
18 months before

1924
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:30,199
I guess 12 months before six bucks a

1925
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:32,320
share they tripled their money yeah

1926
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:33,719
fantastic For What and that was when you

1927
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:36,040
started calling them Partners right when

1928
01:20:33,719 --> 01:20:37,920
they became 91 as soon as be was

1929
01:20:36,040 --> 01:20:39,800
instituted it was everyone was a partner

1930
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,560
and is that when you did the lowercase

1931
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,239
when titles all became low everyone was

1932
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:46,080
lower case from the beginning oh out of

1933
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:48,840
respect everyone's lower case listeners

1934
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:50,280
when you um when you look up a Starbucks

1935
01:20:48,840 --> 01:20:51,920
employee on LinkedIn it always looks

1936
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,280
like is that is that a typo and then you

1937
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:55,480
realize there's a pattern all employees

1938
01:20:54,280 --> 01:20:57,840
always

1939
01:20:55,480 --> 01:21:00,800
put lowercase

1940
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:02,760
titles so another interesting thing

1941
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:05,159
about the uh I was reading the S1 last

1942
01:21:02,760 --> 01:21:09,719
night the management team inclusive of

1943
01:21:05,159 --> 01:21:12,040
you owned 18% but only 9 to 10% of that

1944
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:14,320
was you personally so the rest of the

1945
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:17,040
management team owned just as much as

1946
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:19,800
you did as the founder yeah that does

1947
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:25,120
feel unusually high do you think that

1948
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:27,199
that played a role in sort of getting

1949
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,600
people's buyin and getting them to bleed

1950
01:21:27,199 --> 01:21:31,000
Starbucks as much as you did not

1951
01:21:28,600 --> 01:21:33,639
intentionally no okay not a strategy no

1952
01:21:31,000 --> 01:21:35,239
that was not not a strategy interesting

1953
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:37,600
so then from there you open in

1954
01:21:35,239 --> 01:21:39,520
Washington DC on the East Coast I think

1955
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:41,480
that the reason you picked DC was

1956
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:43,199
because your mail order business was

1957
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:44,840
strong there so you sort of had

1958
01:21:43,199 --> 01:21:46,159
proprietary data to know that that was

1959
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:47,560
going to be a good coffee City I don't

1960
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:51,880
know how you found that out but that's

1961
01:21:47,560 --> 01:21:53,760
accurate in 1995 you cross 500 stores uh

1962
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:55,840
you had just bought the Coffee

1963
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:58,040
Connection as we talked about in Boston

1964
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,760
and uh they had one asset that was

1965
01:21:58,040 --> 01:22:03,000
perhaps much more valuable than any of

1966
01:22:00,760 --> 01:22:04,600
the real estate or any of the uh sales

1967
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,679
that you would generate from there they

1968
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:10,320
owned the trademark on the word

1969
01:22:06,679 --> 01:22:12,199
Frappuccino and I'm so smart that I

1970
01:22:10,320 --> 01:22:15,159
looked at that for frapuccino with

1971
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:17,440
disdain really I didn't like the name I

1972
01:22:15,159 --> 01:22:19,320
didn't like the beverage I I didn't

1973
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,719
think it was appropriate for Starbucks

1974
01:22:19,320 --> 01:22:23,639
and because I just you know I just saw

1975
01:22:21,719 --> 01:22:25,480
Starbucks as such a purity with with

1976
01:22:23,639 --> 01:22:29,000
regard to coffee

1977
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:31,840
and uh I was wrong dead wrong obviously

1978
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:34,760
putting myself in your shoes back then

1979
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:36,560
now Starbucks and frappucino are like a

1980
01:22:34,760 --> 01:22:38,920
it's like a synonym it's like you can't

1981
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:41,360
disentangle them but yeah it's very

1982
01:22:38,920 --> 01:22:43,600
different than completely different a

1983
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:45,960
blended cold drink that was the first

1984
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:48,560
cold drink we've ever introduced it was

1985
01:22:45,960 --> 01:22:50,239
not a coffee forward beverage when we

1986
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:53,000
introduced it in Southern California was

1987
01:22:50,239 --> 01:22:55,520
just it went crazy so what changed your

1988
01:22:53,000 --> 01:22:57,560
mind to Greenlight it I didn't have a

1989
01:22:55,520 --> 01:22:58,840
choice I mean it it was Coffee

1990
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,760
Connection had it then we had it in

1991
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:03,760
Boston people wanted it uh and I just

1992
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,920
went along and you you ended up like

1993
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:07,360
reformulating it right it wasn't exactly

1994
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:10,000
the store manager in Santa Monica

1995
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:12,280
reformatted it and she was on it I think

1996
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:14,679
Howard bear loved it people in

1997
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:16,120
California loved it there's a fantastic

1998
01:23:14,679 --> 01:23:18,400
story about

1999
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:21,360
Frappuccino because of what we did with

2000
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,800
it not in its existing form and Retail

2001
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:25,520
but what we ended up doing with it in

2002
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,800
terms of

2003
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:30,159
leveraging the brand and distribution

2004
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,840
that's a another great story was that

2005
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:34,440
your first bottled drink in retail yeah

2006
01:23:32,840 --> 01:23:37,600
so I went to

2007
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:40,719
Atlanta and Pepsi in the same

2008
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:43,440
day Atlanta being Coke I went to Coke I

2009
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:46,120
went to Pepsi the same day the coke

2010
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:49,040
meeting uh was a meeting lasted less

2011
01:23:46,120 --> 01:23:52,440
than 30 minutes I can't can't remember

2012
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:55,280
who I met with they dismissed me uh

2013
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:56,440
didn't view Starbucks at didn't

2014
01:23:55,280 --> 01:23:58,280
understand what I was trying to do and

2015
01:23:56,440 --> 01:24:01,120
didn't give me much time to even explain

2016
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:04,400
it uh and then I went to Pepsi and this

2017
01:24:01,120 --> 01:24:06,800
is 95 is mid 90s 500 stores your public

2018
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:10,360
company yeah but no one but in East

2019
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:12,320
Coast Starbucks wasn't really well known

2020
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:16,600
so I went to Pepsi and purchased New

2021
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:18,480
York Met Roger enrio the iconic CEO and

2022
01:24:16,600 --> 01:24:21,639
Craig weatherup the president of of

2023
01:24:18,480 --> 01:24:24,600
Pepsi they love the idea and we started

2024
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:28,480
talking about this subsequently Craig

2025
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:32,000
weatherup and I on a napkin I swear

2026
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:34,800
shook hands and created a multi-billion

2027
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:36,960
doll business for Pepsi and Starbucks

2028
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:39,440
and a 50-50 jv on bottle

2029
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:41,560
Frappuccino and Craig weup deserves all

2030
01:24:39,440 --> 01:24:44,400
the credit for that and then Craig

2031
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:47,199
became a board member of Starbucks

2032
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:49,880
oh and Roger and I were friends until

2033
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:51,719
his death and served on the DreamWorks

2034
01:24:49,880 --> 01:24:53,320
board together how did you find yourself

2035
01:24:51,719 --> 01:24:55,000
at Coke and Pepsi pitching a bottled

2036
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:56,760
beverage and was there an internal

2037
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:58,320
Revolt cuz I could imagine people saying

2038
01:24:56,760 --> 01:25:00,119
this is a bridge too far I don't think

2039
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:02,920
people knew what I was even doing I mean

2040
01:25:00,119 --> 01:25:04,159
I think maybe a few people you know I

2041
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,560
just had the thought we got to put this

2042
01:25:04,159 --> 01:25:09,440
in a bottle we have to put this in a

2043
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,760
bottle and this product if I'm

2044
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:14,280
remembering right was so successful the

2045
01:25:11,760 --> 01:25:16,199
instant that it hit sh sore shelves you

2046
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:18,800
had to pull it all off because you

2047
01:25:16,199 --> 01:25:20,480
needed to like create new manufacturing

2048
01:25:18,800 --> 01:25:22,440
processes and spin up new factories in

2049
01:25:20,480 --> 01:25:25,560
order to make enough to actually satisfy

2050
01:25:22,440 --> 01:25:28,400
demand basically correct and we also

2051
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:31,480
early on had a recall where they found

2052
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:34,400
glass in the bottle and Pepsi to its

2053
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:37,960
credit took all the blame for that and

2054
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:41,320
fixed it but yeah it was from minute one

2055
01:25:37,960 --> 01:25:43,400
the the power of Starbucks and bottle

2056
01:25:41,320 --> 01:25:46,239
Frappuccino and doing something we had

2057
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:49,560
never no one it was no bottle of coffee

2058
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:52,280
let alone and uh again just like the

2059
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:54,760
Costco story and the United Airlines

2060
01:25:52,280 --> 01:25:55,760
Story the flywheel

2061
01:25:54,760 --> 01:25:58,360
of the

2062
01:25:55,760 --> 01:26:01,119
awareness and people drinking something

2063
01:25:58,360 --> 01:26:03,760
they could enjoy at home or at work

2064
01:26:01,119 --> 01:26:07,719
again it just created

2065
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:09,080
another level of velocity on the brand I

2066
01:26:07,719 --> 01:26:11,400
mean that I'm just thinking about

2067
01:26:09,080 --> 01:26:15,280
between the cups but then United

2068
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:18,560
Airlines and Costco and the cpg products

2069
01:26:15,280 --> 01:26:20,960
there's got to have been like 50 billion

2070
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:23,840
Starbucks logos printed I'm sure that

2071
01:26:20,960 --> 01:26:25,480
was maybe more maybe more I'm just I'm

2072
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:29,119
sure I could

2073
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:32,360
you can see where the the the the the

2074
01:26:29,119 --> 01:26:35,480
size of the equity of the brand was much

2075
01:26:32,360 --> 01:26:38,119
bigger than the size of the company much

2076
01:26:35,480 --> 01:26:40,679
bigger right because at this point you

2077
01:26:38,119 --> 01:26:43,560
like 800 stores yeah then something else

2078
01:26:40,679 --> 01:26:47,400
happened and that is we wake up one day

2079
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:50,159
and someone says Starbucks is in a movie

2080
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:52,760
we said what movie You've Got

2081
01:26:50,159 --> 01:26:55,119
Mail that wasn't coordinated first of

2082
01:26:52,760 --> 01:26:57,719
all Starbucks never paid for place

2083
01:26:55,119 --> 01:27:00,000
someone must have approved it I I knew

2084
01:26:57,719 --> 01:27:01,480
nothing about it and then someone said

2085
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:04,600
you got to see this movie Starbucks all

2086
01:27:01,480 --> 01:27:07,320
over it what movie Tom Hanks You've Got

2087
01:27:04,600 --> 01:27:09,840
Mail with Meg Ryan I I didn't know

2088
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:10,880
nothing about it it was just another

2089
01:27:09,840 --> 01:27:12,960
thing where it was just like a little

2090
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:14,239
fairy dust on the brand did you know

2091
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:17,000
that it was like the good old days where

2092
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:20,560
you're like this is just like we were so

2093
01:27:17,000 --> 01:27:21,719
in the mud it was so in it that we

2094
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,800
didn't have a we didn't have time to

2095
01:27:21,719 --> 01:27:28,960
look up and we were just running so fast

2096
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:32,000
so hard when you're growing at this pace

2097
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:34,760
it's almost virtually impossible to

2098
01:27:32,000 --> 01:27:38,600
catch the growth in terms of the

2099
01:27:34,760 --> 01:27:40,800
infrastructure and so you're constantly

2100
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:44,000
back and forth trying to create that

2101
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:46,040
fragile balance between the seductive

2102
01:27:44,000 --> 01:27:48,560
nature and the

2103
01:27:46,040 --> 01:27:52,679
intoxication of growth and

2104
01:27:48,560 --> 01:27:56,360
success and the foundation necessary to

2105
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:59,320
support it and not falling too far

2106
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:01,000
behind where you lose it but you never

2107
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,560
are in a position at least we were never

2108
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:06,560
in a position we were we were ahead of

2109
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:09,159
it never and so there was a constant

2110
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:11,360
push and I think this is where Orin was

2111
01:28:09,159 --> 01:28:14,520
the wise man in the room to say how

2112
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:15,920
that's we just can't do that now just we

2113
01:28:14,520 --> 01:28:18,000
don't have the infrastructure we don't

2114
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:20,080
have the people don't have the systems

2115
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:21,920
and you know I'd be screaming we we we

2116
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,600
got to do it if we don't do it someone

2117
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,280
else going to do we got to do it and

2118
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:28,199
that takes us International we weren't

2119
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:30,560
ready for that yeah so I want to putting

2120
01:28:28,199 --> 01:28:33,520
a bow on Frappuccino the year after it

2121
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:36,119
launched in 1996 Frappuccinos were 7% of

2122
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,639
Revenue which I can attest to maybe

2123
01:28:36,119 --> 01:28:41,280
freshman is I had my first with that

2124
01:28:38,639 --> 01:28:42,520
Frappuccino tall mocha Frappuccino with

2125
01:28:41,280 --> 01:28:44,880
whipped cream and a little chocolate

2126
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:46,920
drizzle on top and and like now here I

2127
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:49,400
am drinking what are we drinking here

2128
01:28:46,920 --> 01:28:52,239
you're drinking coffee from India yeah

2129
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:55,400
and no cream no

2130
01:28:52,239 --> 01:28:59,400
sug and so uh know the the Frappuccino

2131
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:03,199
began my journey to the good stuff uh so

2132
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:05,199
that's the Frappuccino story uh 96 97 98

2133
01:29:03,199 --> 01:29:08,840
I mean this is this is the international

2134
01:29:05,199 --> 01:29:10,960
story so I love the Japan Story You've

2135
01:29:08,840 --> 01:29:12,920
me you've told this to me before but um

2136
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:16,040
I'd love to okay I there's a couple of

2137
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:17,239
things about this I started taking a

2138
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:22,280
couple of

2139
01:29:17,239 --> 01:29:25,880
trips uh to Europe and Asia just to get

2140
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:29,840
a sense of what the opportunity would be

2141
01:29:25,880 --> 01:29:33,920
and how would we do it I quickly wrote

2142
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:35,880
off Europe because coffee was there I

2143
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,760
didn't think we could possibly enter as

2144
01:29:35,880 --> 01:29:40,280
an American company and so we just took

2145
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:42,199
Europe coffe be like a uh American

2146
01:29:40,280 --> 01:29:44,239
luxury leather goods company coming in

2147
01:29:42,199 --> 01:29:45,880
and competing with their Mees yeah not

2148
01:29:44,239 --> 01:29:50,320
going to happen and so we said we just

2149
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:53,679
took it off the map and then uh we we

2150
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:57,199
narrowed our Focus very quickly on Japan

2151
01:29:53,679 --> 01:30:00,480
Japan had a couple of thousand coffee

2152
01:29:57,199 --> 01:30:04,280
stores named doour you'd walk in there

2153
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:06,920
and it was Smoke Filled mostly men dark

2154
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:09,800
but they were successful and so I said

2155
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:13,800
to the board we want to go to

2156
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:15,800
Japan the board was incredibly resistant

2157
01:30:13,800 --> 01:30:17,520
to the idea why you've got all this

2158
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:20,199
white space in America there's no need

2159
01:30:17,520 --> 01:30:22,480
to do this at the time and I just said

2160
01:30:20,199 --> 01:30:24,360
okay well and so one thing led to

2161
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:28,040
another and my board memb said if you're

2162
01:30:24,360 --> 01:30:30,159
gonna if you're considering this hire an

2163
01:30:28,040 --> 01:30:34,679
outside resource to do a

2164
01:30:30,159 --> 01:30:36,159
study oh boy I was livid about that you

2165
01:30:34,679 --> 01:30:38,360
know aren't there some Consultants you

2166
01:30:36,159 --> 01:30:41,800
could possibly pay to help you know this

2167
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:44,920
uh and so we we hired a consultant who

2168
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:47,239
came back with a you know big book

2169
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:49,400
presented it to the board I had a

2170
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:51,480
preview and it basically was this is a

2171
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:53,400
non-starter you can't possibly succeed

2172
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:56,639
there and in the meeting I was just I

2173
01:30:53,400 --> 01:30:58,520
could feel my blood just boiling because

2174
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:01,560
with every statement it was getting

2175
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:04,520
worse like the economics won't

2176
01:31:01,560 --> 01:31:05,920
work no one in Japan will ever walk in

2177
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:09,119
the street with a cup of coffee they

2178
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:12,080
would lose face your no smoking policy

2179
01:31:09,119 --> 01:31:14,000
which we had from the beginning is a

2180
01:31:12,080 --> 01:31:15,280
non-starter and you can't afford the

2181
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:17,520
economics to

2182
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:22,239
rent don't

2183
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:24,520
go well that only made me more Furious

2184
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:27,000
it's like they've never met you and more

2185
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:29,840
intentional and

2186
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:34,480
so we were we kept thinking about this

2187
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:37,520
and then one day we get a handwritten

2188
01:31:34,480 --> 01:31:40,840
letter from a Japanese

2189
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:44,119
company and the founder of the company

2190
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:47,480
Eugis son had a la

2191
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:49,920
restaurant and he was enamored with

2192
01:31:47,480 --> 01:31:51,040
Starbucks we sit down with him we fall

2193
01:31:49,920 --> 01:31:54,639
in love with

2194
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:57,360
him and uh we weren't ready

2195
01:31:54,639 --> 01:32:00,679
but we decided we're going to give it a

2196
01:31:57,360 --> 01:32:03,119
shot we go to Tokyo we meet him we ended

2197
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:06,920
up forming a JV and you know the folk

2198
01:32:03,119 --> 01:32:09,520
law at Starbucks which is not that

2199
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:12,480
unrealistic is the reason we went to

2200
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:15,560
Japan as an international market is

2201
01:32:12,480 --> 01:32:19,040
because it had a direct flight to

2202
01:32:15,560 --> 01:32:24,280
Seattle that was the extent of our

2203
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:26,320
understanding now we open up in August

2204
01:32:24,280 --> 01:32:30,199
if you've been to Tokyo in August it's

2205
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:32,960
hot it's like 95 degree temperature and

2206
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:35,280
100% humidity it's like getting out of a

2207
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:37,360
New York City subway in the middle of

2208
01:32:35,280 --> 01:32:40,000
August as soon as you walk out you need

2209
01:32:37,360 --> 01:32:42,719
a shower it's going to be a tough

2210
01:32:40,000 --> 01:32:44,560
opening because of the hot weather I'm

2211
01:32:42,719 --> 01:32:47,159
very concerned about

2212
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:51,000
it I get back to my hotel room and I

2213
01:32:47,159 --> 01:32:54,320
have a message that CNN is covering the

2214
01:32:51,000 --> 01:32:56,920
opening life

2215
01:32:54,320 --> 01:33:00,679
or they got cameras highrisk High reward

2216
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:04,800
wow I'm so nervous at 6:00 a.m. we get

2217
01:33:00,679 --> 01:33:07,080
in the car so hot my the tie around my

2218
01:33:04,800 --> 01:33:10,000
neck it feels like a a

2219
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:13,639
noose we're driving up to the store in

2220
01:33:10,000 --> 01:33:16,119
the Ginza and there's like 200 people

2221
01:33:13,639 --> 01:33:19,119
online and I turned to the translator

2222
01:33:16,119 --> 01:33:22,719
and I said did he hire

2223
01:33:19,119 --> 01:33:24,800
extras I cut the ribbon and a young man

2224
01:33:22,719 --> 01:33:26,880
who slept over the night before to be

2225
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,760
the first person as a college student

2226
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:32,880
speaks no English He rushes to the front

2227
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:36,000
of the line and I follow him no English

2228
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:38,600
and he says double tall

2229
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:42,040
latte as God as my witness just like

2230
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:44,320
that and I said holy

2231
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:48,560
 how did they

2232
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:51,040
know and Japan was a extraordinary

2233
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:52,639
success from minute one we got 2,000

2234
01:33:51,040 --> 01:33:55,199
stores there I was there like two months

2235
01:33:52,639 --> 01:33:56,679
ago incredible we have a roas right

2236
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:59,320
there why were there people lined up

2237
01:33:56,679 --> 01:34:02,119
around the block why did it work so well

2238
01:33:59,320 --> 01:34:05,159
instantly was it a strong Co Coffee

2239
01:34:02,119 --> 01:34:07,920
Culture or the coffee no it was the

2240
01:34:05,159 --> 01:34:09,920
iconic reputation and

2241
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:12,760
anticipation of

2242
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:16,920
something that they had convinced

2243
01:34:12,760 --> 01:34:19,639
themselves was unique proprietary not in

2244
01:34:16,920 --> 01:34:22,360
Tokyo not in Japan that they wanted to

2245
01:34:19,639 --> 01:34:25,920
have and that cup but by the way the

2246
01:34:22,360 --> 01:34:29,040
research that cup was all over

2247
01:34:25,920 --> 01:34:30,040
Tokyo in months everyone was walking

2248
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:34,400
around with that

2249
01:34:30,040 --> 01:34:38,920
cup and this is 9 years after you bought

2250
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:42,679
the six stores it has turned into this

2251
01:34:38,920 --> 01:34:44,560
icon in all the events we just covered

2252
01:34:42,679 --> 01:34:46,320
Starbucks has already become Starbucks

2253
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,159
it is already this like globally

2254
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:51,280
desirable brand there by

2255
01:34:49,159 --> 01:34:54,119
1996 I honestly I haven't thought about

2256
01:34:51,280 --> 01:34:57,199
it in that way but that's so fast I mean

2257
01:34:54,119 --> 01:34:59,040
to build something seem fast to us I bet

2258
01:34:57,199 --> 01:35:01,040
the parallels to the Microsoft story are

2259
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:03,040
just like so you know Japan was

2260
01:35:01,040 --> 01:35:04,320
Microsoft's First International Market

2261
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:06,719
did not know that it was half their

2262
01:35:04,320 --> 01:35:09,360
business and it started in the same way

2263
01:35:06,719 --> 01:35:11,719
Bill and Paul got a cold call from K

2264
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:13,159
Nishi who was a guy in Japan who had

2265
01:35:11,719 --> 01:35:16,080
somehow gotten a hold of the basic

2266
01:35:13,159 --> 01:35:17,360
interpreter loved it and said I'm so

2267
01:35:16,080 --> 01:35:20,000
passionate about this I want to bring it

2268
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:22,639
to Japan 50% of Microsoft's revenue for

2269
01:35:20,000 --> 01:35:25,880
the first at least 5 years and they

2270
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:27,639
stayed 50% International permanently and

2271
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:30,040
that's what took them right you know

2272
01:35:27,639 --> 01:35:32,119
from this Albuquerque to like Hey we're

2273
01:35:30,040 --> 01:35:34,280
International all right listeners this

2274
01:35:32,119 --> 01:35:37,000
is a great time to talk about one of our

2275
01:35:34,280 --> 01:35:39,800
big Partners here in season 14 service

2276
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,800
now yes as you know service now is the

2277
01:35:39,800 --> 01:35:44,000
AI platform for the Enterprise helping

2278
01:35:41,800 --> 01:35:46,199
to automate processes improve Service

2279
01:35:44,000 --> 01:35:49,119
delivery and increase efficiency over

2280
01:35:46,199 --> 01:35:50,719
85% of the Fortune 500 runs on them and

2281
01:35:49,119 --> 01:35:52,480
they have quickly become one of the

2282
01:35:50,719 --> 01:35:55,080
world's most important Enterprise

2283
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:57,080
technology vendors today we want to do a

2284
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:59,159
little case study on how service now

2285
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:02,719
works with another very well-known

2286
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:05,600
consumer brand NASCAR little known fact

2287
01:36:02,719 --> 01:36:08,119
NASCAR is a family-owned business even

2288
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:09,600
at today's scale in their 75th year

2289
01:36:08,119 --> 01:36:10,639
they're continuing to innovate with

2290
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:12,840
events like their race through the

2291
01:36:10,639 --> 01:36:16,320
streets of Chicago and growing with over

2292
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:18,880
1,000 NASCAR sanctioned events per year

2293
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:20,719
y the operations are mind-bending I was

2294
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:22,480
looking into it they move a huge part of

2295
01:36:20,719 --> 01:36:24,960
the company and set up a new base of

2296
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:27,000
operations in a new City every week the

2297
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:29,560
whole thing is like a roving circus that

2298
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:31,600
needs to build a festival from scratch

2299
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:33,639
while keeping consistent infrastructure

2300
01:36:31,600 --> 01:36:36,119
to ensure that fans and teams have a

2301
01:36:33,639 --> 01:36:38,440
seamless experience from race to race so

2302
01:36:36,119 --> 01:36:40,440
how do you do that well Nascar has

2303
01:36:38,440 --> 01:36:41,920
turned to service now to help it become

2304
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,880
one of the most Innovative and

2305
01:36:41,920 --> 01:36:45,960
technologically advanced organizations

2306
01:36:43,880 --> 01:36:47,760
in the sports entertainment industry

2307
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:49,800
with service now they've been able to

2308
01:36:47,760 --> 01:36:51,920
automate manual and outdated business

2309
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:53,960
processes and unify fragmented

2310
01:36:51,920 --> 01:36:55,760
technology into a single platform

2311
01:36:53,960 --> 01:36:58,320
they've also been able to enable their

2312
01:36:55,760 --> 01:37:00,280
employees to build low code applications

2313
01:36:58,320 --> 01:37:02,880
that can be speedily deployed to all

2314
01:37:00,280 --> 01:37:05,199
employees without having big IT projects

2315
01:37:02,880 --> 01:37:07,400
associated with it yeah the NASCAR story

2316
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:09,280
is a classic one for service now they

2317
01:37:07,400 --> 01:37:11,280
first became a customer for the it

2318
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:13,320
operations but as they saw the power of

2319
01:37:11,280 --> 01:37:15,159
the service now platform they extended

2320
01:37:13,320 --> 01:37:17,679
it into every corner of their business

2321
01:37:15,159 --> 01:37:19,199

cross a thousand stores globally you're

2331
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:40,199
getting your feet under you you're

2332
01:37:38,840 --> 01:37:42,280
saying okay International is going to be

2333
01:37:40,199 --> 01:37:46,119
a thing uh in

2334
01:37:42,280 --> 01:37:48,199
1999 you 2,000 stores 2,000 stores

2335
01:37:46,119 --> 01:37:49,800
because we had a goal of 2,000 by 2000

2336
01:37:48,199 --> 01:37:53,760
We Beat It by Year

2337
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:56,320
ah 99 you also open in Beijing what's

2338
01:37:53,760 --> 01:37:58,920
the calculus on entering China and did

2339
01:37:56,320 --> 01:38:01,920
you realize it could become such a

2340
01:37:58,920 --> 01:38:02,880
pillar of the company like it is today I

2341
01:38:01,920 --> 01:38:07,400
I

2342
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:09,119
honestly don't think we had any real

2343
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:11,440
understanding of what we were getting

2344
01:38:09,119 --> 01:38:13,679
into and we went there with a partner

2345
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:16,520
that didn't work out we we I should tell

2346
01:38:13,679 --> 01:38:18,520
you that we we had a theory of the case

2347
01:38:16,520 --> 01:38:21,520
that any International Market that we

2348
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:23,719
opened that didn't speak English we

2349
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:26,119
needed a partner

2350
01:38:23,719 --> 01:38:28,599
and so Japan was a partner

2351
01:38:26,119 --> 01:38:31,239
successful we entered in a partnership

2352
01:38:28,599 --> 01:38:33,679
in China early on that was not

2353
01:38:31,239 --> 01:38:36,800
successful did not share our values and

2354
01:38:33,679 --> 01:38:38,239
we got out and ended up you closed all

2355
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:39,800
the stores no no we got we got out of

2356
01:38:38,239 --> 01:38:43,119
the partnership bought them out and

2357
01:38:39,800 --> 01:38:44,719
became company-owned and so you the that

2358
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:46,000
that was legal to do that to be an

2359
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:48,560
American-owned

2360
01:38:46,000 --> 01:38:51,960
company in China yeah but we struggled

2361
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:54,239
in China for almost a decade lost money

2362
01:38:51,960 --> 01:38:55,760
there was tremendous pressure inside the

2363
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:59,639
company of clothes

2364
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:02,040
China until Belinda

2365
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:06,119
Wang maybe the most valuable person in

2366
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:08,480
the company from my view really yeah

2367
01:39:06,119 --> 01:39:09,880
when did Belinda get involved with

2368
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:12,360
Belinda was working she started with

2369
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:14,400
Starbucks in Singapore but she was

2370
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:18,520
working in Hong Kong we were open in

2371
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:21,000
Hong Kong and uh I I saw something in

2372
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:24,679
her who was just an extraordinary

2373
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:26,760
operator and had a touch with people and

2374
01:39:24,679 --> 01:39:29,320
I said and we were dying in China we're

2375
01:39:26,760 --> 01:39:33,599
really in trouble would you come to

2376
01:39:29,320 --> 01:39:35,239
China and run it and she said I would do

2377
01:39:33,599 --> 01:39:38,159
I would consider doing

2378
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:41,159
that uh but you've got to decentralize

2379
01:39:38,159 --> 01:39:44,440
it and we couldn't do that right away it

2380
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:46,719
was just too much but she changed the

2381
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:49,199
course of history for Starbucks in China

2382
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:50,400
what year was that that she came that

2383
01:39:49,199 --> 01:39:52,679
she took over the role I think it's

2384
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:55,199
about a decade after we opened okay well

2385
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:57,960
I I there today I ask because I want to

2386
01:39:55,199 --> 01:40:01,560
come back to it there's a whole interim

2387
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:03,679
you know between 2000 and 2008 where you

2388
01:40:01,560 --> 01:40:06,400
are not the CEO of the company right so

2389
01:40:03,679 --> 01:40:08,080
in 2000 I mean if if if you if you've

2390
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:10,760
been listening to this episode the theme

2391
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:12,599
that should be occurring to you is oh my

2392
01:40:10,760 --> 01:40:13,920
God basically everything worked and I

2393
01:40:12,599 --> 01:40:15,679
know it didn't feel like that on the

2394
01:40:13,920 --> 01:40:17,400
inside but like you read all those

2395
01:40:15,679 --> 01:40:19,560
Investment Banking reports and it's like

2396
01:40:17,400 --> 01:40:20,920
hey Starbucks uh here's all these price

2397
01:40:19,560 --> 01:40:22,040
targets for Starbucks and here's what we

2398
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:24,080
think they're going to do in earnings

2399
01:40:22,040 --> 01:40:26,840
and oh they beat it again like I don't

2400
01:40:24,080 --> 01:40:29,159
know 30 40 quarters in a row it's just

2401
01:40:26,840 --> 01:40:30,880
like this uh I would say perfectly

2402
01:40:29,159 --> 01:40:32,719
predictable except you actually kept

2403
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:35,159
exceeding the expectations so it wasn't

2404
01:40:32,719 --> 01:40:36,239
predictable I did a 100 quarterly

2405
01:40:35,159 --> 01:40:38,480
conference

2406
01:40:36,239 --> 01:40:40,400
calls as

2407
01:40:38,480 --> 01:40:43,400
CEO

2408
01:40:40,400 --> 01:40:44,760
100 yeah that's a lot I bet that's a lot

2409
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:46,440
of earnings prep because each one of

2410
01:40:44,760 --> 01:40:48,360
those has what two weeks before it of

2411
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:49,440
the truth is the majority of those were

2412
01:40:48,360 --> 01:40:51,800
no

2413
01:40:49,440 --> 01:40:53,800
script which became the Le the lawyers

2414
01:40:51,800 --> 01:40:56,239
took over after that many years no

2415
01:40:53,800 --> 01:40:57,760
script which is your preferred

2416
01:40:56,239 --> 01:40:59,599
communication style I mean it seems like

2417
01:40:57,760 --> 01:41:01,360
whenever I see you up speaking there's

2418
01:40:59,599 --> 01:41:05,719
there's no teleprompters there's it's

2419
01:41:01,360 --> 01:41:07,679
from the heart so at this point I don't

2420
01:41:05,719 --> 01:41:10,199
want to say it it would be incorrect to

2421
01:41:07,679 --> 01:41:12,760
say Starbucks is running itself but like

2422
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:14,679
it's in a great place right and you step

2423
01:41:12,760 --> 01:41:16,520
into the role of is it executive

2424
01:41:14,679 --> 01:41:20,800
chairman chairman yes executive chair

2425
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:23,639
with Orin as a CEO in 2000 yeah what was

2426
01:41:20,800 --> 01:41:26,280
your I was I was I think I was

2427
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:28,080
physically and emotionally

2428
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:30,719
exhausted

2429
01:41:28,080 --> 01:41:33,400
um kids were getting older I had missed

2430
01:41:30,719 --> 01:41:35,560
a lot just think about all the things we

2431
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:38,000
were doing and I had so much confidence

2432
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:40,599
in or so it was no problem and so that's

2433
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:43,280
what I did but I was still engaged but I

2434
01:41:40,599 --> 01:41:45,360
was you know not running it day-to-day

2435
01:41:43,280 --> 01:41:47,560
and at this point it's 3500 stores the

2436
01:41:45,360 --> 01:41:50,040
company's doing 2.2 billion in Revenue

2437
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,480
it kind of feels like okay I can I can

2438
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:53,400
get some distance I can do other things

2439
01:41:51,480 --> 01:41:56,119
in life it's it's you know it's going to

2440
01:41:53,400 --> 01:41:58,639
work out at some point Orin transitions

2441
01:41:56,119 --> 01:42:01,199
the CEO Ro to Jim Donald which I assume

2442
01:41:58,639 --> 01:42:04,199
you also very involved in in working

2443
01:42:01,199 --> 01:42:07,400
with him um what was that transition

2444
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:10,280
about Orin never wanted to be the

2445
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:14,760
CEO he's not a front

2446
01:42:10,280 --> 01:42:17,400
guy uh in fact he's shy and uh did never

2447
01:42:14,760 --> 01:42:19,199
wanted to be on the stage as a CEO so he

2448
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,440
said I'll do it for a couple of years

2449
01:42:19,199 --> 01:42:21,400
but he's always kind of knocking on my

2450
01:42:20,440 --> 01:42:24,400
door

2451
01:42:21,400 --> 01:42:26,639
saying we we need a new SE H and we

2452
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:30,560
didn't have anyone internally be didn't

2453
01:42:26,639 --> 01:42:34,280
want it um and so we did a search we met

2454
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:35,599
Jim Donald great great guy had all this

2455
01:42:34,280 --> 01:42:40,000
operational

2456
01:42:35,599 --> 01:42:41,679
experience um and then certain things

2457
01:42:40,000 --> 01:42:43,119
started appearing and we were just

2458
01:42:41,679 --> 01:42:45,639
weren't hitting our stride the way we

2459
01:42:43,119 --> 01:42:48,440
usually do the economic environment was

2460
01:42:45,639 --> 01:42:51,840
getting tougher and

2461
01:42:48,440 --> 01:42:53,880
uh things just kind of unveiled itself

2462
01:42:51,840 --> 01:42:56,199
that we it wasn't going to work out

2463
01:42:53,880 --> 01:42:58,520
by the way but Jim is a great guy like a

2464
01:42:56,199 --> 01:43:01,639
really good person but it just wasn't in

2465
01:42:58,520 --> 01:43:05,040
the right fit and so how long had he

2466
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:07,440
been in that role of CEO I'd say less

2467
01:43:05,040 --> 01:43:11,560
than three years two years maybe but

2468
01:43:07,440 --> 01:43:13,840
basically the um 2008 happens and so the

2469
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:16,679
cataclysmic financial crisis is

2470
01:43:13,840 --> 01:43:17,760
unfolding and uh that plus the cracks

2471
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:22,199
that we were

2472
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:23,719
experiencing uh board meeting and I

2473
01:43:22,199 --> 01:43:25,960
don't think the board meeting was set up

2474
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:27,480
for me to return but it just kind of

2475
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,560
happened in the meeting about okay we

2476
01:43:27,480 --> 01:43:31,639
got all these problems what are we going

2477
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:34,520
to do do you want to come back

2478
01:43:31,639 --> 01:43:35,920
and yeah I'm going to come back and that

2479
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:37,199
wasn't that was never your intent when

2480
01:43:35,920 --> 01:43:38,400
you stepped away you thought you were it

2481
01:43:37,199 --> 01:43:39,280
was not my intent to come back it was

2482
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,040
certainly not my intent to we're going

2483
01:43:39,280 --> 01:43:45,360
to run into problems and so in the

2484
01:43:43,040 --> 01:43:48,239
Christmas Vacation of

2485
01:43:45,360 --> 01:43:52,280
2007 I knew I was going to return in

2486
01:43:48,239 --> 01:43:53,760
January so I was on holiday and I was

2487
01:43:52,280 --> 01:43:57,599
starting to think through what I was

2488
01:43:53,760 --> 01:44:00,239
going to do on that holiday a friend of

2489
01:43:57,599 --> 01:44:03,400
mine not I didn't know he was there but

2490
01:44:00,239 --> 01:44:06,159
it was Michael del was there and I must

2491
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:08,159
have talked to him almost every day

2492
01:44:06,159 --> 01:44:09,920
about the transformation of Starbucks

2493
01:44:08,159 --> 01:44:12,199
and he was going through a similar thing

2494
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:15,080
at Dell almost at the same time so we

2495
01:44:12,199 --> 01:44:16,800
had so many things to talk about and we

2496
01:44:15,080 --> 01:44:21,159
were comparing notes and

2497
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:24,199
everything and so in early 2008 I spoke

2498
01:44:21,159 --> 01:44:27,599
to Jim and I came back in

2499
01:44:24,199 --> 01:44:29,560
8 and when you came back in 2008 I mean

2500
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:31,719
this is the whole Crux of your book

2501
01:44:29,560 --> 01:44:32,960
onward there's an entire books worth of

2502
01:44:31,719 --> 01:44:35,719
material here so we're not going to do

2503
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:38,440
it all but uh suffice to say just to put

2504
01:44:35,719 --> 01:44:40,880
some numbers on it um the market cap had

2505
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:43,480
dropped from $30 billion to less than $7

2506
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:45,520
billion same Source sales the the

2507
01:44:43,480 --> 01:44:47,639
comparables number when you compare the

2508
01:44:45,520 --> 01:44:49,360
store this quarter last year to this

2509
01:44:47,639 --> 01:44:53,159
quarter you know or this year to last

2510
01:44:49,360 --> 01:44:54,320
year um had dropped growth began to slow

2511
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:57,119
uh and so you come in and you have to

2512
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:59,119
make these really horrible decisions

2513
01:44:57,119 --> 01:45:00,320
you're faced with two terrible options

2514
01:44:59,119 --> 01:45:04,719
and you got to make the right decisions

2515
01:45:00,320 --> 01:45:06,599
for the business I uh first of every

2516
01:45:04,719 --> 01:45:10,400
Rock I turned over was worse than I

2517
01:45:06,599 --> 01:45:11,639
thought there were a lot of unperformed

2518
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:14,280
stores that should have never been

2519
01:45:11,639 --> 01:45:17,159
opened that we need to close I think we

2520
01:45:14,280 --> 01:45:18,599
closed a thousand stores and I had a

2521
01:45:17,159 --> 01:45:21,080
companywide

2522
01:45:18,599 --> 01:45:24,599
meeting I remember it vividly because I

2523
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:26,800
started crying and and apologize to

2524
01:45:24,599 --> 01:45:29,400
everybody that we got to close stores we

2525
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:32,159
got to lay people off and I mean just

2526
01:45:29,400 --> 01:45:34,239
think about you know we were on a a

2527
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:35,840
trajectory for all this time and all of

2528
01:45:34,239 --> 01:45:37,400
a sudden we not only hit a speed bump

2529
01:45:35,840 --> 01:45:40,159
but the world the music was just

2530
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:42,440
stopping the stock price I think broke

2531
01:45:40,159 --> 01:45:44,960
$6 I was so afraid that we were going to

2532
01:45:42,440 --> 01:45:46,440
get acquired but the only cover we had

2533
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:49,440
is that the world was coming undone so

2534
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:51,840
no one had any resources but I was

2535
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:54,119
terrified I just stood up and apologized

2536
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,320
and said we we we've let you down I

2537
01:45:54,119 --> 01:45:58,480
promise I'm do my best but we're trying

2538
01:45:56,320 --> 01:46:01,040
to save the company and literally we

2539
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:03,520
were trying to save Starbucks things

2540
01:46:01,040 --> 01:46:05,080
were that bad you say that we were

2541
01:46:03,520 --> 01:46:06,360
trying to save Starbucks and in my head

2542
01:46:05,080 --> 01:46:08,080
I always thought well it couldn't have

2543
01:46:06,360 --> 01:46:09,440
been that bad this is big successful

2544
01:46:08,080 --> 01:46:11,119
company it's fast growing it's

2545
01:46:09,440 --> 01:46:14,880
profitable and then I read you were

2546
01:46:11,119 --> 01:46:17,400
seven months from being insolvent so we

2547
01:46:14,880 --> 01:46:19,199
had uh we didn't have enough cash comps

2548
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:21,920
had we never had negative comps in the

2549
01:46:19,199 --> 01:46:24,360
history of Starbucks so negative I

2550
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:26,119
didn't single quarter was better than 12

2551
01:46:24,360 --> 01:46:29,440
mon never had never had a negative comp

2552
01:46:26,119 --> 01:46:31,639
month in my history of of the company I

2553
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:32,960
didn't even understand how it I

2554
01:46:31,639 --> 01:46:34,480
understand it such an

2555
01:46:32,960 --> 01:46:38,280
anomaly

2556
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:41,840
so um we we close all those

2557
01:46:38,280 --> 01:46:44,440
stores and um then you got to decide

2558
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:46,880
okay how do we how do we turn it what

2559
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:49,800
what do we do and I think going back to

2560
01:46:46,880 --> 01:46:53,239
your line of questions in the past about

2561
01:46:49,800 --> 01:46:54,760
the people is of all the things things

2562
01:46:53,239 --> 01:47:00,400
that I could point

2563
01:46:54,760 --> 01:47:03,320
to that demonstrates what Starbucks is

2564
01:47:00,400 --> 01:47:05,679
has been and needs to be it's the

2565
01:47:03,320 --> 01:47:07,880
humanity and the people of the company

2566
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:09,440
the company was

2567
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:12,400
built

2568
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:14,119
on being a performance-driven company

2569
01:47:12,400 --> 01:47:16,760
through the lens of humanity that's how

2570
01:47:14,119 --> 01:47:21,119
it was built and whenever we've lost our

2571
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:23,599
way we've lost our way because people in

2572
01:47:21,119 --> 01:47:26,280
power didn't understand

2573
01:47:23,599 --> 01:47:30,159
understand that

2574
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:32,159
equation and so I I just said we need I

2575
01:47:30,159 --> 01:47:34,719
I need to be in front of every store

2576
01:47:32,159 --> 01:47:37,639
manager I need a meeting with 10,000

2577
01:47:34,719 --> 01:47:39,679
people it's the big conference room and

2578
01:47:37,639 --> 01:47:42,760
so in

2579
01:47:39,679 --> 01:47:45,280
2008 no American company was

2580
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:48,400
traveling and so the municipalities were

2581
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:50,440
hungry for Starbucks to potentially have

2582
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:52,880
a meeting at a

2583
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:55,360
discount and so we got we had Detroit

2584
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,679
come in we had Houston come in and then

2585
01:47:55,360 --> 01:48:01,119
New Orleans came in what they presented

2586
01:47:57,679 --> 01:48:02,800
to us was the need for Starbucks to come

2587
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:05,000
as a result of

2588
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:07,800
Katrina and when we heard that we

2589
01:48:05,000 --> 01:48:09,560
realized we've got to go to New Orleans

2590
01:48:07,800 --> 01:48:11,159
and in fact what we're going to do in

2591
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:14,679
New Orleans is we're going to have one

2592
01:48:11,159 --> 01:48:18,199
full day of 50,000 hours of community

2593
01:48:14,679 --> 01:48:22,159
service in the ninth ward next day we we

2594
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:23,760
walked through and we built basically a

2595
01:48:22,159 --> 01:48:26,679
tutorial

2596
01:48:23,760 --> 01:48:28,080
on how to restore the business and have

2597
01:48:26,679 --> 01:48:29,520
people walk through it and we had

2598
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:34,360
classes and we had all these things

2599
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:37,560
going on and the third day was my speech

2600
01:48:34,360 --> 01:48:41,599
in the basketball Coliseum to 10,000

2601
01:48:37,560 --> 01:48:44,760
people I'm about an hour before I was

2602
01:48:41,599 --> 01:48:47,840
really feeling the burden of how

2603
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:50,599
important what I was going to say is and

2604
01:48:47,840 --> 01:48:54,199
the CFO at the time who subsequently

2605
01:48:50,599 --> 01:48:57,119
resigned a week later wasn't my

2606
01:48:54,199 --> 01:49:00,159
guy asked me what I'm going to

2607
01:48:57,119 --> 01:49:02,960
say and I said I'm going to tell him the

2608
01:49:00,159 --> 01:49:04,080
truth and he says you can't possibly do

2609
01:49:02,960 --> 01:49:08,119
that you're going to scare the out

2610
01:49:04,080 --> 01:49:10,360
of them I went up there and I laid it

2611
01:49:08,119 --> 01:49:13,599
out chapter and

2612
01:49:10,360 --> 01:49:16,400
verse I think we have seven months

2613
01:49:13,599 --> 01:49:18,440
left we are going to be

2614
01:49:16,400 --> 01:49:19,920
insolvent I can see why he was freaked

2615
01:49:18,440 --> 01:49:22,119
out about this like if word got out to

2616
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:24,360
Wall Street that yeah well social media

2617
01:49:22,119 --> 01:49:27,639
didn't exist that time but I just laid

2618
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:29,679
it out what if that store was the

2619
01:49:27,639 --> 01:49:32,440
difference between the food on your

2620
01:49:29,679 --> 01:49:35,000
table and its success and then I had

2621
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:38,119
this economic formula of how many

2622
01:49:35,000 --> 01:49:41,719
customers it would take per store to

2623
01:49:38,119 --> 01:49:44,960
turn comps around and the number was low

2624
01:49:41,719 --> 01:49:48,239
it's like less than 10 per day or 11 per

2625
01:49:44,960 --> 01:49:52,080
day H and so I said let's just talk

2626
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:54,560
about New Orleans you know how many new

2627
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:57,560
incremental customers it'll take in your

2628
01:49:54,560 --> 01:50:00,880
store and it's ma was manageable and

2629
01:49:57,560 --> 01:50:03,040
tangible mhm anyway right because you

2630
01:50:00,880 --> 01:50:05,080
could actually imagine okay if 10 more

2631
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:06,719
people walk in the door today and I

2632
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:09,000
Delight them in a particular way that

2633
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:10,320
brings them back tomorrow like we're

2634
01:50:09,000 --> 01:50:12,040
turning this thing around or we're

2635
01:50:10,320 --> 01:50:14,199
turning this one store around and if

2636
01:50:12,040 --> 01:50:16,440
everybody does that yeah and and the

2637
01:50:14,199 --> 01:50:18,760
problem when you get this big is you

2638
01:50:16,440 --> 01:50:20,280
start thinking about large numbers but

2639
01:50:18,760 --> 01:50:22,320
if you reduce it to the lowest lowest

2640
01:50:20,280 --> 01:50:24,960
common denominator one store one cup of

2641
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:29,520
coffee One customer one partner and what

2642
01:50:24,960 --> 01:50:33,560
if all of that works well we rushed out

2643
01:50:29,520 --> 01:50:37,520
of New Orleans like an effing tidal wave

2644
01:50:33,560 --> 01:50:39,880
and we never looked back and less than a

2645
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:41,639
year was turned and you you did crazy I

2646
01:50:39,880 --> 01:50:44,440
mean the the tactics involved in the

2647
01:50:41,639 --> 01:50:46,199
turnaround the we close the stores for

2648
01:50:44,440 --> 01:50:49,040
what noon onward right for an entire

2649
01:50:46,199 --> 01:50:51,119
afternoon an evening because the

2650
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:53,840
previous

2651
01:50:51,119 --> 01:50:56,119
administration had done things that

2652
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:58,440
diluted the Integrity of coffee to

2653
01:50:56,119 --> 01:51:01,679
maximine

2654
01:50:58,440 --> 01:51:04,280
yield like what what does that mean well

2655
01:51:01,679 --> 01:51:06,480
let's say you're making a batch of brw

2656
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:08,119
coffee yep well what if that brw coffee

2657
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:10,199
was based on a number of ounces of

2658
01:51:08,119 --> 01:51:12,800
coffee what if you just reduced it just

2659
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:16,079
a little bit no one's going to

2660
01:51:12,800 --> 01:51:18,079
know just little things little little

2661
01:51:16,079 --> 01:51:20,520
10,000 little sounds good in theory

2662
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:23,400
scratches of efficiency that dilute The

2663
01:51:20,520 --> 01:51:26,400
Experience yeah huh but that does seem

2664
01:51:23,400 --> 01:51:28,800
like a reflects a misunderstanding of

2665
01:51:26,400 --> 01:51:32,639
the fundamental business that this is a

2666
01:51:28,800 --> 01:51:35,560
business about a store with high gross

2667
01:51:32,639 --> 01:51:39,599
margins based on Customer

2668
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:43,159
Loyalty but we were beginning to face

2669
01:51:39,599 --> 01:51:47,599
headwinds MH and what are the headwinds

2670
01:51:43,159 --> 01:51:49,880
headwinds were the level of attrition of

2671
01:51:47,599 --> 01:51:52,119
customers as the financial climate

2672
01:51:49,880 --> 01:51:53,159
deteriorated spending that $6 on the

2673
01:51:52,119 --> 01:51:55,880
latte

2674
01:51:53,159 --> 01:51:57,880
daily get hard to justify and we weren't

2675
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:59,440
as good as we we were when we were small

2676
01:51:57,880 --> 01:52:00,480
yeah then it makes it easier to give up

2677
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:03,239
yeah and this goes back to what I said

2678
01:52:00,480 --> 01:52:07,360
earlier growth covers up mistakes and

2679
01:52:03,239 --> 01:52:10,040
success breeds yubis and it did how

2680
01:52:07,360 --> 01:52:11,520
could it not I mean how how could you

2681
01:52:10,040 --> 01:52:12,920
Starbucks today is so freaking

2682
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:14,880
ubiquitous which again is one of the

2683
01:52:12,920 --> 01:52:16,199
things I love about it it's consistent

2684
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,639
anywhere I travel in the world I can

2685
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:19,400
count on it I can mobile order and pay

2686
01:52:17,639 --> 01:52:22,560
there's all these wonderful things but

2687
01:52:19,400 --> 01:52:25,679
when you become like government level

2688
01:52:22,560 --> 01:52:27,800
scale in the world people assume it's a

2689
01:52:25,679 --> 01:52:29,760
piece of public infrastructure I assume

2690
01:52:27,800 --> 01:52:31,480
employees even must feel that way during

2691
01:52:29,760 --> 01:52:34,159
some periods of time of like we're so

2692
01:52:31,480 --> 01:52:37,320
big we're just but the the worst thing

2693
01:52:34,159 --> 01:52:39,599
that Starbucks could have become and the

2694
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:41,239
worst thing that Starbucks could become

2695
01:52:39,599 --> 01:52:45,560
is a

2696
01:52:41,239 --> 01:52:48,960
utility scale and ubiquity creates

2697
01:52:45,560 --> 01:52:52,079
complexity complexity demands

2698
01:52:48,960 --> 01:52:52,960
efficiency but we are in a business

2699
01:52:52,079 --> 01:52:54,560
where

2700
01:52:52,960 --> 01:52:57,079
that touch point between the customer

2701
01:52:54,560 --> 01:53:01,040
and the Barista has to be

2702
01:52:57,079 --> 01:53:03,440
protected and has to be elevated now

2703
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:05,360
then you get stores that are so busy

2704
01:53:03,440 --> 01:53:08,239
where the Barista can't even look up

2705
01:53:05,360 --> 01:53:09,520
can't look up and then you get mobile UD

2706
01:53:08,239 --> 01:53:12,119
and pay which we haven't even talked

2707
01:53:09,520 --> 01:53:14,079
about which is you know is a thing I

2708
01:53:12,119 --> 01:53:16,480
love and do every day and depersonalizes

2709
01:53:14,079 --> 01:53:19,320
the experience by definition yes

2710
01:53:16,480 --> 01:53:21,280
Starbucks demands nurturance it's it's a

2711
01:53:19,320 --> 01:53:24,400
a company that has to be nurtured like a

2712
01:53:21,280 --> 01:53:27,400
young child that is an anomaly

2713
01:53:24,400 --> 01:53:29,840
inconsistent with scale and you get

2714
01:53:27,400 --> 01:53:32,280
people coming into the company with

2715
01:53:29,840 --> 01:53:34,840
different experience different

2716
01:53:32,280 --> 01:53:37,199
language the immersion doesn't quite hit

2717
01:53:34,840 --> 01:53:40,360
them in the heart or the soul or the

2718
01:53:37,199 --> 01:53:41,639
conscience of the company they they feel

2719
01:53:40,360 --> 01:53:43,960
like they're doing a good job but it's

2720
01:53:41,639 --> 01:53:45,520
not the job that's consistent with the

2721
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:48,760
integrity and

2722
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:50,719
Heritage of what the company has been

2723
01:53:48,760 --> 01:53:53,639
metaphorically let's let's say that's a

2724
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:56,920
giant Reservoir if you're taking a

2725
01:53:53,639 --> 01:53:59,520
deposit on a consistent basis out of the

2726
01:53:56,920 --> 01:54:02,400
reservoir and it's getting dry you

2727
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:05,280
better stop you better make sure you're

2728
01:54:02,400 --> 01:54:07,639
making a deposit so they're equal and

2729
01:54:05,280 --> 01:54:10,360
it's balanced when you get

2730
01:54:07,639 --> 01:54:12,920
this that's when the company loses the

2731
01:54:10,360 --> 01:54:14,840
plot and if you get this and you're

2732
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:18,800
making a lot of money and the stock

2733
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:21,760
price is high people say it's okay we're

2734
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:23,599
fine and that's Fool's Gold it's it's a

2735
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:26,079
camouflage because eventually it's going

2736
01:54:23,599 --> 01:54:27,840
to bite you in the ass have you ever

2737
01:54:26,079 --> 01:54:30,520
figured out a way to measure these

2738
01:54:27,840 --> 01:54:33,360
things in a way that like as long as

2739
01:54:30,520 --> 01:54:35,599
these numbers that that the numbers are

2740
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:38,159
a direct tie to our values are good we

2741
01:54:35,599 --> 01:54:42,000
can actually put a kpi against them we

2742
01:54:38,159 --> 01:54:43,840
know that the core is solid I I haven't

2743
01:54:42,000 --> 01:54:46,880
been smart enough to figure that out but

2744
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:52,639
I mean I think the interesting thing to

2745
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:55,679
me today is that the Asian business

2746
01:54:52,639 --> 01:54:58,960
is operating at a much higher

2747
01:54:55,679 --> 01:55:01,800
level of the soft side of

2748
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:05,079
Starbucks than we are in the

2749
01:55:01,800 --> 01:55:07,040
US and I now I understand your Belinda

2750
01:55:05,079 --> 01:55:09,800
Wong comment that doesn't answer your

2751
01:55:07,040 --> 01:55:14,280
question about quantifying it but when I

2752
01:55:09,800 --> 01:55:18,280
am in Asia I see things that

2753
01:55:14,280 --> 01:55:20,119
are very elevated to the brand that

2754
01:55:18,280 --> 01:55:22,679
speak to the financial performance of

2755
01:55:20,119 --> 01:55:24,520
those markets which are very high okay

2756
01:55:22,679 --> 01:55:26,040
before we get to today I want to talk

2757
01:55:24,520 --> 01:55:29,480
about some other things that happened in

2758
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:31,560
2008 2008 was a big year so 2008 2009

2759
01:55:29,480 --> 01:55:33,920
2010 there's no way to put it other than

2760
01:55:31,560 --> 01:55:36,480
a wildly successful turnaround your low

2761
01:55:33,920 --> 01:55:40,079
point in 2008 profits were 315 million

2762
01:55:36,480 --> 01:55:42,520
and by 2010 they were 945 million I mean

2763
01:55:40,079 --> 01:55:43,679
I don't know how we did that well we

2764
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:46,599
just went through a lot of the ways of

2765
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:48,800
how you did that there's a couple other

2766
01:55:46,599 --> 01:55:51,320
things here one of which is technology

2767
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:52,880
but I'm told there's a a story you have

2768
01:55:51,320 --> 01:55:54,440
about Steve Jobs

2769
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:57,679
around this point in time too funny

2770
01:55:54,440 --> 01:56:01,880
story another story and

2771
01:55:57,679 --> 01:56:04,520
so in Hawaii when I was on vacation I'm

2772
01:56:01,880 --> 01:56:07,199
talking to Michael Dell and Benny off

2773
01:56:04,520 --> 01:56:09,000
and you're uh cycling with cycling with

2774
01:56:07,199 --> 01:56:11,079
Dell almost every day and I'm talking to

2775
01:56:09,000 --> 01:56:12,040
Benny Michael introduced me to Benny

2776
01:56:11,079 --> 01:56:13,719
didn't know

2777
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:17,880
him and

2778
01:56:13,719 --> 01:56:23,800
so his a pretty good Hawaii crew okay so

2779
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:25,679
I get back and um Adam brotman was a key

2780
01:56:23,800 --> 01:56:28,480
person in all this in terms of mobile

2781
01:56:25,679 --> 01:56:30,079
order and pay yeah he ran digital for

2782
01:56:28,480 --> 01:56:32,040
Starbucks yeah he ran digital I'm trying

2783
01:56:30,079 --> 01:56:35,480
to make sure I got the sequencing of

2784
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:39,159
this right I think there was

2785
01:56:35,480 --> 01:56:40,320
a future meeting scheduled for Starbucks

2786
01:56:39,159 --> 01:56:42,119
and

2787
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:44,760
apple uh

2788
01:56:42,119 --> 01:56:48,719
around mobile order and pay and other

2789
01:56:44,760 --> 01:56:51,000
things and I met Steve on a phone

2790
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:53,480
call I never met him talking to him on

2791
01:56:51,000 --> 01:56:54,960
the phone and I I'm telling him what's

2792
01:56:53,480 --> 01:56:56,920
going on he said you should come down

2793
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:59,199
and he had a whole thing about walking

2794
01:56:56,920 --> 01:57:01,840
he would go out we'd walk around the

2795
01:56:59,199 --> 01:57:03,599
building you heard this before infinite

2796
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:05,280
loop at their old campus yeah yeah yeah

2797
01:57:03,599 --> 01:57:07,480
and so I went down there and and

2798
01:57:05,280 --> 01:57:09,000
basically went down and we took a walk

2799
01:57:07,480 --> 01:57:10,320
and I just told him all my problems

2800
01:57:09,000 --> 01:57:11,560
everything was going on and he just

2801
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:13,960
stopped me and he said this is what you

2802
01:57:11,560 --> 01:57:16,560
need to do this looked me and he said

2803
01:57:13,960 --> 01:57:19,199
you go back to Seattle and you fire

2804
01:57:16,560 --> 01:57:21,079
everyone on your leadership team I

2805
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:22,320
thought he was joking I said what do you

2806
01:57:21,079 --> 01:57:25,760
mean fire what are you talking about

2807
01:57:22,320 --> 01:57:27,840

2808
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:30,679
and fire all those people he's like

2809
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:32,679
screaming at me in my face you know fire

2810
01:57:30,679 --> 01:57:34,480
all those people that's what I would do

2811
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:36,360
I said Steve I can't fire all the people

2812
01:57:34,480 --> 01:57:39,960
who's going to do the work he said I

2813
01:57:36,360 --> 01:57:41,760
promise you in six months maybe nine

2814
01:57:39,960 --> 01:57:44,560
they'll all be

2815
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,679
gone he was right except for one The

2816
01:57:44,560 --> 01:57:48,639
General Counsel they were all gone your

2817
01:57:46,679 --> 01:57:50,119
whole leadership team turned over after

2818
01:57:48,639 --> 01:57:53,239
they were all

2819
01:57:50,119 --> 01:57:54,840
gone wow that's story about stew jobs

2820
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:56,000
wow did you ever call him back and tell

2821
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:59,480
him I talked to him since then and we

2822
01:57:56,000 --> 01:58:01,960
were on stage together at an event and I

2823
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:03,599
told them they're they're all gone well

2824
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:04,480
you're 6 months nine months late man

2825
01:58:03,599 --> 01:58:06,119
think about all the things you could

2826
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:08,440
have done of

2827
01:58:06,119 --> 01:58:11,679
course all right that's that story so

2828
01:58:08,440 --> 01:58:14,639
while we're in technology land then

2829
01:58:11,679 --> 01:58:17,599
um I think today

2830
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:19,599
33% of Starbucks orders are done with

2831
01:58:17,599 --> 01:58:22,239
mobile order and pay so obviously this

2832
01:58:19,599 --> 01:58:24,520
you know huge pillar of of Starbucks as

2833
01:58:22,239 --> 01:58:26,719
it exists in our world how did that

2834
01:58:24,520 --> 01:58:29,880
start yeah yeah you had been on pen and

2835
01:58:26,719 --> 01:58:32,360
paper then you moved to dos and now you

2836
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:34,199
have the most sophisticated technology

2837
01:58:32,360 --> 01:58:36,560
platform of probably any retailer in

2838
01:58:34,199 --> 01:58:39,719
World at the time so you're talking to a

2839
01:58:36,560 --> 01:58:42,119
non-te person so I'm not I'm not focused

2840
01:58:39,719 --> 01:58:45,840
on anything other than the customer

2841
01:58:42,119 --> 01:58:48,440
experience y uh Adam Brockman to his

2842
01:58:45,840 --> 01:58:52,920
credit along with Steven Gillette who's

2843
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:56,840
who was at Starbucks very shortly

2844
01:58:52,920 --> 01:58:58,320
came to us with the idea of building a

2845
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:00,440
mobile

2846
01:58:58,320 --> 01:59:02,400
app I didn't know what it was what do

2847
01:59:00,440 --> 01:59:03,880
you honestly we're in the meeting I'm

2848
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,800
trying to figure out what what are you

2849
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:07,800
actually talking about how are they

2850
01:59:04,800 --> 01:59:10,079
going to do that they created and apps

2851
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:13,079
at this point I mean if it came out in

2852
01:59:10,079 --> 01:59:16,800
2009 which was the first version the iOS

2853
01:59:13,079 --> 01:59:18,560
SDK came out in summer 2008 summer 2008

2854
01:59:16,800 --> 01:59:20,000
so it's like you know you're one of the

2855
01:59:18,560 --> 01:59:21,560
very if they're having this idea and

2856
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:23,560
bringing it to you it's like months

2857
01:59:21,560 --> 01:59:27,159
after

2858
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:28,719
exist well they're they get complete

2859
01:59:27,159 --> 01:59:32,760
credit

2860
01:59:28,719 --> 01:59:36,400
for assembling the pieces of all

2861
01:59:32,760 --> 01:59:38,520
this convincing us to fund it and we

2862
01:59:36,400 --> 01:59:43,520
were off and running I don't think any

2863
01:59:38,520 --> 01:59:46,079
of us honestly for myself really knew

2864
01:59:43,520 --> 01:59:47,599
what they were actually going to create

2865
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:52,040
they explained it to us but I didn't

2866
01:59:47,599 --> 01:59:57,679
really I didn't get it until I saw it

2867
01:59:52,040 --> 01:59:57,679
and holy overnight it was just an

2868
01:59:57,760 --> 02:00:02,880
unbelievable new

2869
02:00:00,079 --> 02:00:04,800
vehicle now if we fast forward I don't

2870
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:08,000
know if you want to do that here of what

2871
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:10,679
it's become yeah it

2872
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:13,719
is the biggest Achilles heel for

2873
02:00:10,679 --> 02:00:14,760
Starbucks really and it's not even a

2874
02:00:13,719 --> 02:00:16,560
close

2875
02:00:14,760 --> 02:00:18,920
second and

2876
02:00:16,560 --> 02:00:23,440
so the mobile

2877
02:00:18,920 --> 02:00:26,520
app created unbelievable

2878
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:28,719
convenience for our customers but

2879
02:00:26,520 --> 02:00:30,880
remember we are an

2880
02:00:28,719 --> 02:00:35,560
experiential

2881
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:38,280
brand and so as this thing was

2882
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:41,119
growing there was never an

2883
02:00:38,280 --> 02:00:44,199
opportunity because it it it it became

2884
02:00:41,119 --> 02:00:47,400
so seductive for the

2885
02:00:44,199 --> 02:00:49,079
company it also created a even better

2886
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:50,840
business model for you right it was more

2887
02:00:49,079 --> 02:00:53,719
efficient and you get the float with

2888
02:00:50,840 --> 02:00:57,560
yeah with all that is true but at but it

2889
02:00:53,719 --> 02:01:00,599
was beginning to deteriorate yeah at a

2890
02:00:57,560 --> 02:01:02,920
rapid rate the the third place

2891
02:01:00,599 --> 02:01:07,320
experience in the sense of

2892
02:01:02,920 --> 02:01:10,320
community and then it became it

2893
02:01:07,320 --> 02:01:12,800
overflowed to the point where it

2894
02:01:10,320 --> 02:01:14,880
disproportionately created an

2895
02:01:12,800 --> 02:01:18,400
environment in our stores where the

2896
02:01:14,880 --> 02:01:20,800
mobile app became the primary

2897
02:01:18,400 --> 02:01:23,079
vehicle as well as the primary vehicle

2898
02:01:20,800 --> 02:01:25,040
for dissatisfaction

2899
02:01:23,079 --> 02:01:27,639
because people couldn't get their drink

2900
02:01:25,040 --> 02:01:30,920
on time people were confused whether

2901
02:01:27,639 --> 02:01:32,760
that was their drink a lot of anxiety

2902
02:01:30,920 --> 02:01:36,560
and the thing I remember the most is

2903
02:01:32,760 --> 02:01:38,199
that we were in Chicago at 8:00 a.m.

2904
02:01:36,560 --> 02:01:40,880
because people wanted to show me the

2905
02:01:38,199 --> 02:01:43,960
problem and so everyone is getting off

2906
02:01:40,880 --> 02:01:46,079
the loop the train at 8:00 a.m. and

2907
02:01:43,960 --> 02:01:48,119
everyone who ordered on their app it

2908
02:01:46,079 --> 02:01:50,239
says the same thing your drink's going

2909
02:01:48,119 --> 02:01:53,079
to be ready in seven minutes and

2910
02:01:50,239 --> 02:01:54,239
everyone shows up and all of a sudden we

2911
02:01:53,079 --> 02:01:56,800
got a mosh

2912
02:01:54,239 --> 02:01:59,679
pit and that's not

2913
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:03,360
Starbucks and so the

2914
02:01:59,679 --> 02:02:06,440
company did not do a good job of

2915
02:02:03,360 --> 02:02:09,159
anticipating the technological

2916
02:02:06,440 --> 02:02:12,159
refinements that needed to be put in

2917
02:02:09,159 --> 02:02:14,679
place to avoid what was

2918
02:02:12,159 --> 02:02:17,520
happening and I want to be fair to

2919
02:02:14,679 --> 02:02:20,119
everyone who's managed the company for

2920
02:02:17,520 --> 02:02:21,920
about a five-year period remember I

2921
02:02:20,119 --> 02:02:23,560
haven't I wasn't involved in the company

2922
02:02:21,920 --> 02:02:26,000
from basically

2923
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:29,880
2018 to

2924
02:02:26,000 --> 02:02:32,480
2022 yep not I wasn't I was not involved

2925
02:02:29,880 --> 02:02:36,400
you stayed CEO from 2008 until

2926
02:02:32,480 --> 02:02:39,520
2017 then I left and

2927
02:02:36,400 --> 02:02:41,320
um there were no bad people and no one

2928
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:43,159
had bad

2929
02:02:41,320 --> 02:02:44,599
intentions but the Heritage and

2930
02:02:43,159 --> 02:02:48,400
tradition of what I've described which

2931
02:02:44,599 --> 02:02:50,360
is so vital to the nurturance was lost

2932
02:02:48,400 --> 02:02:52,000
well it must have been so seductive yeah

2933
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:55,079
the stock we the stock was at record

2934
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:57,840
High and the company was not

2935
02:02:55,079 --> 02:03:01,920
investing ahead of the curve and not

2936
02:02:57,840 --> 02:03:04,440
paying attention to the velocity of the

2937
02:03:01,920 --> 02:03:06,880
mobile app and what it was becoming

2938
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:08,159
until it was too late and now and the

2939
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:11,159
company has that problem today which

2940
02:03:08,159 --> 02:03:14,159
they will solve but it's it's late and

2941
02:03:11,159 --> 02:03:17,000
also everyone has caught up to we we

2942
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:18,880
were the only game in town and and the

2943
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:21,320
novelty of that and the uniqueness of it

2944
02:03:18,880 --> 02:03:22,280
especially for our product MH and

2945
02:03:21,320 --> 02:03:24,760
everyone

2946
02:03:22,280 --> 02:03:26,639
pretty much copied it it is interesting

2947
02:03:24,760 --> 02:03:27,880
to David keeps saying it's so seductive

2948
02:03:26,639 --> 02:03:29,880
to put some numbers for listeners

2949
02:03:27,880 --> 02:03:31,079
wondering you know why is the mobile app

2950
02:03:29,880 --> 02:03:33,280
such an interesting thing David pointed

2951
02:03:31,079 --> 02:03:35,119
out the float so of course uh if you

2952
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:37,400
look at Starbucks uh financial

2953
02:03:35,119 --> 02:03:40,320
statements right now at any given time

2954
02:03:37,400 --> 02:03:42,199
there's about $1.8 billion doar of cash

2955
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:44,320
that Starbucks has gotten in the form

2956
02:03:42,199 --> 02:03:46,639
effectively of as an advance from

2957
02:03:44,320 --> 02:03:48,840
customers that Starbucks can use to

2958
02:03:46,639 --> 02:03:51,159
operate it's like this amazing growth

2959
02:03:48,840 --> 02:03:53,800
Capital you know store expansion etc etc

2960
02:03:51,159 --> 02:03:57,280
right not the only one I mean everyone

2961
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:58,800
right you know the Amazon has this Apple

2962
02:03:57,280 --> 02:04:01,159
has this brire has this the insurance

2963
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:04,599
business but it's effectively interest

2964
02:04:01,159 --> 02:04:05,920
free loan from customers and a loan

2965
02:04:04,599 --> 02:04:07,880
that's not all going to get called at

2966
02:04:05,920 --> 02:04:09,760
once it's uh some of it will never get

2967
02:04:07,880 --> 02:04:11,719
called right the the breakage and so

2968
02:04:09,760 --> 02:04:14,880
there's this benefit of like it's a

2969
02:04:11,719 --> 02:04:17,960
reasonably predictable amount of cash

2970
02:04:14,880 --> 02:04:21,280
that comes in that you get to use um you

2971
02:04:17,960 --> 02:04:22,440
know for your advantage uh in terms of

2972
02:04:21,280 --> 02:04:26,639
velocity

2973
02:04:22,440 --> 02:04:29,440
about4 billion a year gets loaded onto

2974
02:04:26,639 --> 02:04:31,960
gift cards that's unbelievable I mean

2975
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:34,079
that if you actually like look at all of

2976
02:04:31,960 --> 02:04:37,000
the banks in America if Starbucks were a

2977
02:04:34,079 --> 02:04:40,360
bank and you treated the gift cards as

2978
02:04:37,000 --> 02:04:43,440
deposits it would be in the top 10% by

2979
02:04:40,360 --> 02:04:46,119
deposits of banks in the United States

2980
02:04:43,440 --> 02:04:49,360
it's this like unbelievable business

2981
02:04:46,119 --> 02:04:50,960
model that happens to exist inside of

2982
02:04:49,360 --> 02:04:52,639
this experiential business that powers

2983
02:04:50,960 --> 02:04:54,920
this experiential business but to your

2984
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:57,559
point you have to keep it from eating

2985
02:04:54,920 --> 02:05:00,719
the core yeah so let's just go back not

2986
02:04:57,559 --> 02:05:02,360
to the economics but the the idea itself

2987
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:03,520
and I think whether we talked about

2988
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:07,040
bottle

2989
02:05:03,520 --> 02:05:10,520
Frappuccino the cup you just thread all

2990
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:14,119
these things there is there is a common

2991
02:05:10,520 --> 02:05:15,360
through line and that is we took a

2992
02:05:14,119 --> 02:05:18,880
commodity

2993
02:05:15,360 --> 02:05:22,320
business and we transformed it into a

2994
02:05:18,880 --> 02:05:24,599
premium product brand and experience

2995
02:05:22,320 --> 02:05:28,199
but when you are disrupting the

2996
02:05:24,599 --> 02:05:31,280
market there has to be some governor on

2997
02:05:28,199 --> 02:05:34,800
the on the disruptive innovation to

2998
02:05:31,280 --> 02:05:38,920
monitor how is it being used how is it

2999
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:41,760
being abused and the era of judgment in

3000
02:05:38,920 --> 02:05:44,679
the period where this was really kind

3001
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:48,119
of uh where we really took hold this

3002
02:05:44,679 --> 02:05:50,360
fiveyear period between 2018 and 2022

3003
02:05:48,119 --> 02:05:52,280
it's a governor didn't exist oh you feel

3004
02:05:50,360 --> 02:05:56,280
like it wasn't really taking hold in

3005
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:57,920
that whole it was taking before you know

3006
02:05:56,280 --> 02:05:59,599
and and I'm not criticizing anyone

3007
02:05:57,920 --> 02:06:03,000
because you know we're all everyone's

3008
02:05:59,599 --> 02:06:06,320
trying to do a good job but the the the

3009
02:06:03,000 --> 02:06:07,800
result is the the the runner the The

3010
02:06:06,320 --> 02:06:11,239
Unbelievable

3011
02:06:07,800 --> 02:06:13,040
success it disrupted The Experience yeah

3012
02:06:11,239 --> 02:06:15,159
and now you have stores that are

3013
02:06:13,040 --> 02:06:18,599
entirely built to just pick up mobile

3014
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:23,480
orders and so and and my view is we

3015
02:06:18,599 --> 02:06:25,800
should not succumb to the mobile app

3016
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:27,280
looking back now and not when you're in

3017
02:06:25,800 --> 02:06:28,520
the moment and you and others in the

3018
02:06:27,280 --> 02:06:31,480
management team things happen but

3019
02:06:28,520 --> 02:06:34,000
knowing what you know now yeah are there

3020
02:06:31,480 --> 02:06:36,159
a couple key design decisions or things

3021
02:06:34,000 --> 02:06:39,079
that you would re architect differently

3022
02:06:36,159 --> 02:06:40,440
about the mobile app experience I I

3023
02:06:39,079 --> 02:06:41,679
don't think I would have allowed the

3024
02:06:40,440 --> 02:06:46,239
mobile

3025
02:06:41,679 --> 02:06:51,239
app to be on demand 24 hours a

3026
02:06:46,239 --> 02:06:52,239
day h i I would have slowed rolled the

3027
02:06:51,239 --> 02:06:55,280
the

3028
02:06:52,239 --> 02:06:58,280
availability of it and then understood

3029
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:59,400
how it was being used and whe and

3030
02:06:58,280 --> 02:07:01,559
whether or not it was going to disrupt

3031
02:06:59,400 --> 02:07:03,520
the experience but now it's it's you

3032
02:07:01,559 --> 02:07:05,360
know on demand whenever you want it

3033
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:07,719
right and now you can't you can't shut

3034
02:07:05,360 --> 02:07:11,159
it off from

3035
02:07:07,719 --> 02:07:12,599
8 whenever I get that that message um

3036
02:07:11,159 --> 02:07:14,559
you know mobile Order ahead is not

3037
02:07:12,599 --> 02:07:16,199
available at this time I'm like H but

3038
02:07:14,559 --> 02:07:18,400
it's available 99% of the time it's not

3039
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:19,360
available now and because the store I

3040
02:07:18,400 --> 02:07:21,000
won't even go to a store if it doesn't

3041
02:07:19,360 --> 02:07:22,880
have the store's overun you wouldn't go

3042
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:23,840
yeah that breaks my heart I hate that

3043
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,840
hate to hear

3044
02:07:23,840 --> 02:07:28,520
that well there I went to the precidio

3045
02:07:26,840 --> 02:07:30,679
store yesterday in San Francisco and I

3046
02:07:28,520 --> 02:07:32,520
would go there no matter what but if you

3047
02:07:30,679 --> 02:07:34,920
know I only agree with you in airports

3048
02:07:32,520 --> 02:07:36,880
in airports I'm so time constrained that

3049
02:07:34,920 --> 02:07:38,360
I'm like if mobile order isn't working

3050
02:07:36,880 --> 02:07:39,880
the line's too long oh but I've had

3051
02:07:38,360 --> 02:07:42,079
plenty of times where like I'm looking

3052
02:07:39,880 --> 02:07:43,480
at stores in the radius I'm in I'm

3053
02:07:42,079 --> 02:07:44,599
traveling I'm in a new city and it's

3054
02:07:43,480 --> 02:07:46,880
like well I'm only going to go to the

3055
02:07:44,599 --> 02:07:49,040
one that's open for mobile order and pay

3056
02:07:46,880 --> 02:07:50,960
I'm not even going to try I got to hit

3057
02:07:49,040 --> 02:07:53,679
one other Howard I know you hate it but

3058
02:07:50,960 --> 02:07:56,360
one other like amazing business model

3059
02:07:53,679 --> 02:07:58,599
benefit of mobile order and pay if I'm

3060
02:07:56,360 --> 02:08:00,400
buying $6 lattes over and over again

3061
02:07:58,599 --> 02:08:02,880
with my Visa card and Starbucks is

3062
02:08:00,400 --> 02:08:06,320
getting hit with 30 cents every time

3063
02:08:02,880 --> 02:08:08,599
instead if I'm buying $25 gift cards

3064
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:09,960
well that's now three out of four times

3065
02:08:08,599 --> 02:08:11,920
I'm I'm going and buying my coffee and

3066
02:08:09,960 --> 02:08:14,040
Starbucks doesn't have to pay Visa 30

3067
02:08:11,920 --> 02:08:18,679
cents or the bank 30 cents that's a

3068
02:08:14,040 --> 02:08:20,520
pretty amazing business unlock like you

3069
02:08:18,679 --> 02:08:22,440
know I'm I I'm aware it degrades The

3070
02:08:20,520 --> 02:08:25,440
Experience so you have to find ways to

3071
02:08:22,440 --> 02:08:29,119
deal with that but I I'd be more than

3072
02:08:25,440 --> 02:08:32,159
willing to sacrifice economics to go

3073
02:08:29,119 --> 02:08:36,599
back to ways to enhance the experience

3074
02:08:32,159 --> 02:08:39,559
myself but I'm not unch

3075
02:08:36,599 --> 02:08:41,239
charge all right listeners this is the

3076

focused accounting firm in the entire us

3084
02:08:58,280 --> 02:09:03,239
we talk all the time on acquired about

3085
02:09:00,199 --> 02:09:05,920
Jeff bezos's AWS inspired Axiom that

3086
02:09:03,239 --> 02:09:08,360

3087
02:09:05,920 --> 02:09:10,520
beer taste better in other words only

3088
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:12,079
spend your limited time and resources

3089
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:13,400
only on what's actually going to move

3090
02:09:12,079 --> 02:09:15,400
the needle for your product and

3091
02:09:13,400 --> 02:09:16,960
customers and Outsource everything else

3092
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:19,280
that you need to do as a company but

3093
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:21,559
doesn't fit that bill yeah while we're

3094
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:23,480
in beverage land Starbucks is actually

3095
02:09:21,559 --> 02:09:25,040
great example of this there are so many

3096
02:09:23,480 --> 02:09:27,000
things that are not proprietary to

3097
02:09:25,040 --> 02:09:28,599
Starbucks for the most part they don't

3098
02:09:27,000 --> 02:09:30,480
own the real estate that the stores are

3099
02:09:28,599 --> 02:09:32,360
in they don't manufacture the bottle

3100
02:09:30,480 --> 02:09:34,119
beverages like Frappuccinos that you see

3101
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:36,320
in grocery stores they use Pepsi for

3102
02:09:34,119 --> 02:09:38,199
that and they don't make their own cups

3103
02:09:36,320 --> 02:09:40,239
napkins silverware any of that from

3104
02:09:38,199 --> 02:09:43,280
scratch they focus on what makes their

3105
02:09:40,239 --> 02:09:45,239
coffee taste better I love that for

3106
02:09:43,280 --> 02:09:47,880
startups and growth stage companies

3107
02:09:45,239 --> 02:09:50,320
accounting is example number one of this

3108
02:09:47,880 --> 02:09:52,159
idea every company needs it it needs to

3109
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:54,280
be done by a professional and you don't

3110
02:09:52,159 --> 02:09:56,760
want to take any risk of something going

3111
02:09:54,280 --> 02:09:58,559
wrong but at the same time it has zero

3112
02:09:56,760 --> 02:10:01,719
impact on your actual product or

3113
02:09:58,559 --> 02:10:04,239

sections of your board decks and they've

3123

3126
02:10:26,559 --> 02:10:30,280
yep and when you say thousands of

3127
02:10:28,119 --> 02:10:33,000
companies pilot does this for these are

3128
02:10:30,280 --> 02:10:35,159
now companies like open AI air table and

3129
02:10:33,000 --> 02:10:37,199
scale as well as large e-commerce and

3130
02:10:35,159 --> 02:10:38,880
other companies so it's not just that

3131
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:40,480
they have experience across startups

3132
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:42,760
they can also keep working with you as

3133
02:10:40,480 --> 02:10:44,559
you scale to the growth phase and Beyond

3134
02:10:42,760 --> 02:10:46,440
so if your company or a company you

3135
02:10:44,559 --> 02:10:48,559
start in the future wants to go back to

3136
02:10:46,440 --> 02:10:50,559
focusing on what makes your beer or

3137
02:10:48,559 --> 02:10:51,719
coffee taste better go on over to

3138
02:10:50,559 --> 02:10:53,559
pilot.com

3139
02:10:51,719 --> 02:10:56,800
Acquired and tell them that Ben and

3140
02:10:53,559 --> 02:10:59,520
David sent you thanks pilot moving on

3141
02:10:56,800 --> 02:11:02,559
from technology and mobile order and pay

3142
02:10:59,520 --> 02:11:05,159
there's one more to my mind key pillar

3143
02:11:02,559 --> 02:11:07,280
of the Starbucks tapestry and that's

3144
02:11:05,159 --> 02:11:09,079
real estate and maybe this is a good

3145
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:11,199
time because I feel like around this era

3146
02:11:09,079 --> 02:11:12,679
is when people started looking at

3147
02:11:11,199 --> 02:11:14,520
Starbucks and scratching their heads and

3148
02:11:12,679 --> 02:11:15,920
being like there's two Starbucks across

3149
02:11:14,520 --> 02:11:20,079
the corner from one another these guys

3150
02:11:15,920 --> 02:11:23,079
must be insane uh talk to us about real

3151
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:23,079
estate

3152
02:11:23,599 --> 02:11:33,000
uh the the basic idea early

3153
02:11:28,040 --> 02:11:37,199
on uh given the beverages velocity in

3154
02:11:33,000 --> 02:11:41,119
am uh was to find a corner location in

3155
02:11:37,199 --> 02:11:44,040
an urban setting where we could

3156
02:11:41,119 --> 02:11:47,520
physically see pedestrian traffic in a

3157
02:11:44,040 --> 02:11:49,440
significant way and so we would go to

3158
02:11:47,520 --> 02:11:51,800
cities and

3159
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:54,159
count just physically account how many

3160
02:11:51,800 --> 02:11:59,119
people were walking by what hours they

3161
02:11:54,159 --> 02:12:02,199
walking by and once we had a model of

3162
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:05,800
success it became clear to us what we

3163
02:12:02,199 --> 02:12:08,520
needed and also once we became aware of

3164
02:12:05,800 --> 02:12:12,280
co- tencies of certain tenants that

3165
02:12:08,520 --> 02:12:14,119
would be interesting to us um we also

3166
02:12:12,280 --> 02:12:17,599
were very intrigued with being next to a

3167
02:12:14,119 --> 02:12:19,599
grocery store early on because of the

3168
02:12:17,599 --> 02:12:22,119
frequency in which people were buying

3169
02:12:19,599 --> 02:12:23,920
food anytime were in an office building

3170
02:12:22,119 --> 02:12:27,320
where there was 3 to 4 th000 people in a

3171
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:30,800
building that was a home run but then it

3172
02:12:27,320 --> 02:12:33,119
became very clear that there were

3173
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:36,679
locations that we never imagined we

3174
02:12:33,119 --> 02:12:38,360
could be in that became wildly

3175
02:12:36,679 --> 02:12:41,559
successful and just opened up an

3176
02:12:38,360 --> 02:12:44,119
aperture to us that

3177
02:12:41,559 --> 02:12:46,440
basically we had opportunities to do

3178
02:12:44,119 --> 02:12:48,440
things that were not traditional for a

3179
02:12:46,440 --> 02:12:50,880
retailer now the other thing which we

3180
02:12:48,440 --> 02:12:53,239
haven't talked about is the decision I

3181
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:54,239
made early on not the franchise which

3182
02:12:53,239 --> 02:12:57,679
you haven't surprised you haven't

3183
02:12:54,239 --> 02:12:59,880
mentioned that oh well there were

3184
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:01,280
franchises but I'll let me explain that

3185
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:04,440
if I can which is all part of the real

3186
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:06,520
estate strategy I I never

3187
02:13:04,440 --> 02:13:09,040
believed that we

3188
02:13:06,520 --> 02:13:11,960
could build

3189
02:13:09,040 --> 02:13:15,280
maintain and Elevate the culture of the

3190
02:13:11,960 --> 02:13:18,199
company which I viewed as the thing in a

3191
02:13:15,280 --> 02:13:21,320
franchise system where we had individual

3192
02:13:18,199 --> 02:13:23,320
franchisees who had their own subculture

3193
02:13:21,320 --> 02:13:25,840
and so even though there was pressure

3194
02:13:23,320 --> 02:13:28,559
early on because of the cost of capital

3195
02:13:25,840 --> 02:13:31,760
and we didn't have a lot of money to

3196
02:13:28,559 --> 02:13:34,400
franchise we'd have no capex I said no

3197
02:13:31,760 --> 02:13:36,960
we resisted that and I don't think we'd

3198
02:13:34,400 --> 02:13:39,880
be having this conversation if Starbucks

3199
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:42,559
was a franchise system because

3200
02:13:39,880 --> 02:13:44,679
McDonald's extraordinary company but

3201
02:13:42,559 --> 02:13:47,040
they're they're a commodity-based

3202
02:13:44,679 --> 02:13:48,040
product what was he been saying it's

3203
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:50,719
from the beginning it was about

3204
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:52,320
elevating yeah McDonald's great company

3205
02:13:50,719 --> 02:13:53,880
but nobody would ever accuse them of

3206
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:57,159
elevating I don't think yeah and that's

3207
02:13:53,880 --> 02:13:59,520
why I I I don't want Starbucks to become

3208
02:13:57,159 --> 02:14:03,360
transactional coffee is

3209
02:13:59,520 --> 02:14:04,800
personal the biggest magic and what you

3210
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:08,719
know the lightning in the bottle is when

3211
02:14:04,800 --> 02:14:11,440
you go to Japan or Shanghai or Malaysia

3212
02:14:08,719 --> 02:14:13,800
and you see the

3213
02:14:11,440 --> 02:14:16,159
culture in a way that you just can't

3214
02:14:13,800 --> 02:14:18,719
believe like how did it happen that we

3215
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:20,239
were able to transfer this to another

3216
02:14:18,719 --> 02:14:22,360
country different language different

3217
02:14:20,239 --> 02:14:24,000
culture different how do we do it that's

3218
02:14:22,360 --> 02:14:27,199
actually quite befuddling to me cuz so

3219
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:30,159
many food and beverage Concepts do not

3220
02:14:27,199 --> 02:14:32,679
transfer geographies and and I think it

3221
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:36,079
transferred

3222
02:14:32,679 --> 02:14:37,520
because young people around the world we

3223
02:14:36,079 --> 02:14:40,599
all want the same

3224
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:43,360
thing they want opportunity they want to

3225
02:14:40,599 --> 02:14:45,320
be respected they want to be rep they

3226
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:47,559
want they want dignity they want to make

3227
02:14:45,320 --> 02:14:50,280
their parents proud they want to work

3228
02:14:47,559 --> 02:14:52,040
for a company that they believe in and

3229
02:14:50,280 --> 02:14:55,400
when I see what we've done around the

3230
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:58,239
world I'm moved emotionally because the

3231
02:14:55,400 --> 02:14:59,760
humanity I speak of is universal that's

3232
02:14:58,239 --> 02:15:01,880
why when I came back from China what I

3233
02:14:59,760 --> 02:15:05,159
said was I just want to say something

3234
02:15:01,880 --> 02:15:07,960
about China and the US I know all the

3235
02:15:05,159 --> 02:15:10,440
rhetoric and the propaganda about our

3236
02:15:07,960 --> 02:15:13,559
two countries but what I see is that we

3237
02:15:10,440 --> 02:15:15,440
have so much more in common than we have

3238
02:15:13,559 --> 02:15:16,800
differences and that should be the theme

3239
02:15:15,440 --> 02:15:19,639
of the world right

3240
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:22,520
now I want to pick up the thread on

3241
02:15:19,639 --> 02:15:25,480
China now that we're of into the 2010s

3242
02:15:22,520 --> 02:15:27,320
okay this decade saw huge ridiculous

3243
02:15:25,480 --> 02:15:29,719
growth in China store openings so there

3244
02:15:27,320 --> 02:15:31,159
were 500 stores in 2011 right when

3245
02:15:29,719 --> 02:15:34,079
you're sort of coming out of that the

3246
02:15:31,159 --> 02:15:36,679
the rut by 2017 there were 3,000 today

3247
02:15:34,079 --> 02:15:38,840
there's almost 7,000 and there was a

3248
02:15:36,679 --> 02:15:43,079
stat that was reported that a new store

3249
02:15:38,840 --> 02:15:45,840
opened in China every 15 hours in 2017

3250
02:15:43,079 --> 02:15:47,639
true now bring us to that seed that you

3251
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:49,639
planted earlier with Belinda being the

3252
02:15:47,639 --> 02:15:52,719
single most important

3253
02:15:49,639 --> 02:15:56,280
employee China

3254
02:15:52,719 --> 02:15:59,079
presented the enormity of

3255
02:15:56,280 --> 02:16:00,559
opportunity with the significant

3256
02:15:59,079 --> 02:16:02,760
challenge of

3257
02:16:00,559 --> 02:16:05,520
pioneering and it's a tea drinking

3258
02:16:02,760 --> 02:16:07,880
culture yeah tea drinking culture no

3259
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:11,320
morning business people eating rice in

3260
02:16:07,880 --> 02:16:14,360
the morning we got real estate wrong we

3261
02:16:11,320 --> 02:16:17,040
got breakfast wrong but it was all

3262
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:19,599
coming from the control of

3263
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:21,840
Seattle did you go in with essentially

3264
02:16:19,599 --> 02:16:23,400
the Starbucks concept yeah was exactly

3265
02:16:21,840 --> 02:16:25,440
what you see right now there's no no

3266
02:16:23,400 --> 02:16:27,280
different but they didn't know the

3267
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:30,480
Chinese people hardly knew what coffee

3268
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:32,920
was there was no morning

3269
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:35,160
traffic and in the early days of our

3270
02:16:32,920 --> 02:16:38,719
partner we we didn't see eye to eye so

3271
02:16:35,160 --> 02:16:41,080
we got them out when Belinda came along

3272
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:44,120
we had a worldclass operator who had

3273
02:16:41,080 --> 02:16:48,519
succeeded in Singapore and Hong Kong

3274
02:16:44,120 --> 02:16:51,519
she's a strong person who believed that

3275
02:16:48,519 --> 02:16:54,359
Seattle the way we were organized was

3276
02:16:51,519 --> 02:16:56,639
not a formula for Success you can't have

3277
02:16:54,359 --> 02:16:58,639
people in Starbucks in Seattle designing

3278
02:16:56,639 --> 02:17:00,880
the breakfast menu who have never been

3279
02:16:58,639 --> 02:17:03,599
to China who think we're they're going

3280
02:17:00,880 --> 02:17:06,519
to eat blueberry muffins and so when she

3281
02:17:03,599 --> 02:17:10,800
said to me I will do

3282
02:17:06,519 --> 02:17:13,000
it if I'm in control of everything so I

3283
02:17:10,800 --> 02:17:17,040
want to decentralize

3284
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:21,880
China I report to you it's you and me

3285
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:21,880
and John Culver who runs International

3286
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:27,679
take Seattle out of the

3287
02:17:24,679 --> 02:17:32,040
equation we were failing what choice did

3288
02:17:27,679 --> 02:17:34,800
I have H she turned it she

3289
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,960
singlehandedly built the China business

3290
02:17:34,800 --> 02:17:42,120
today 18% of Starbucks's revenue is

3291
02:17:36,960 --> 02:17:45,000
China yeah she deserves all the

3292
02:17:42,120 --> 02:17:46,960
credit John and I have been to China

3293
02:17:45,000 --> 02:17:50,280
almost every quarter during the building

3294
02:17:46,960 --> 02:17:52,240
years of turning it with her and all the

3295
02:17:50,280 --> 02:17:54,639
government me meetings to tell the

3296
02:17:52,240 --> 02:17:57,000
Starbucks story and and then we did

3297
02:17:54,639 --> 02:18:00,359
things in China

3298
02:17:57,000 --> 02:18:02,439
disruptively well Belinda decided that

3299
02:18:00,359 --> 02:18:04,599
she could go to the government and go to

3300
02:18:02,439 --> 02:18:07,439
an insurance company and come back to

3301
02:18:04,599 --> 02:18:10,519
Starbucks and get government approval

3302
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:12,599
for Starbucks to do the F do something

3303
02:18:10,519 --> 02:18:15,439
had never been done before and provide

3304
02:18:12,599 --> 02:18:17,639
health insurance to the parents and

3305
02:18:15,439 --> 02:18:21,760
grandparents of our

3306
02:18:17,639 --> 02:18:25,280
partners cool so

3307
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:27,280
the Chinese government was so intrigued

3308
02:18:25,280 --> 02:18:30,439
sitting down with them saying can you

3309
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:33,200
can you explain why do you want to do

3310
02:18:30,439 --> 02:18:35,120
this right you don't have to yeah right

3311
02:18:33,200 --> 02:18:37,840
yeah because it's the culture of our

3312
02:18:35,120 --> 02:18:41,920
company we we want to do everything we

3313
02:18:37,840 --> 02:18:43,519
can to benefit our people humanity and

3314
02:18:41,920 --> 02:18:47,559
it's

3315
02:18:43,519 --> 02:18:48,439
Universal but it's so I think important

3316
02:18:47,559 --> 02:18:52,559
to

3317
02:18:48,439 --> 02:18:54,080
just um create at some guard

3318
02:18:52,559 --> 02:18:57,519
rails

3319
02:18:54,080 --> 02:19:00,040
so one day in the early stages of

3320
02:18:57,519 --> 02:19:02,519
Starbucks Howard beer comes to my office

3321
02:19:00,040 --> 02:19:06,559
one day remember we're small at this

3322
02:19:02,519 --> 02:19:08,319
stage and he says we we got a terrible

3323
02:19:06,559 --> 02:19:11,160
situation

3324
02:19:08,319 --> 02:19:14,519
said the manager of the Seattle trust

3325
02:19:11,160 --> 02:19:17,800
store on second in Madison Seattle Tom

3326
02:19:14,519 --> 02:19:17,800
carrian has

3327
02:19:18,080 --> 02:19:24,760
AIDS now AIDS at that time time was like

3328
02:19:22,679 --> 02:19:27,439
leprosy

3329
02:19:24,760 --> 02:19:31,280
leprosy so he Tom comes

3330
02:19:27,439 --> 02:19:33,679
in and he says I need to resign from

3331
02:19:31,280 --> 02:19:36,280
Starbucks and he's

3332
02:19:33,679 --> 02:19:38,120
crying do you have any health

3333
02:19:36,280 --> 02:19:42,920
insurance

3334
02:19:38,120 --> 02:19:46,040
no and so we covered Tom carrian from

3335
02:19:42,920 --> 02:19:48,840
that point on but it was those kinds of

3336
02:19:46,040 --> 02:19:52,240
imprinting moments and there were many

3337
02:19:48,840 --> 02:19:52,960
like that right I think it's funny so I

3338
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:56,479
have

3339
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:57,960
heard that story probably five times

3340
02:19:56,479 --> 02:19:59,280
because I've consumed an incredible

3341
02:19:57,960 --> 02:20:02,160
amount of Starbucks content over the

3342
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:04,080
last couple months and I've heard a a

3343
02:20:02,160 --> 02:20:07,319
story about

3344
02:20:04,080 --> 02:20:11,080
uh Starbucks employees wanting to buy a

3345
02:20:07,319 --> 02:20:14,040
cow for a farmer in Africa and stories

3346
02:20:11,080 --> 02:20:15,720
about Flint Michigan and stories about

3347
02:20:14,040 --> 02:20:17,160
get the initiative to bring the company

3348
02:20:15,720 --> 02:20:18,680
together to try to bring the country

3349
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:21,760
together when the government was shut

3350
02:20:18,680 --> 02:20:23,200
down in 2013 whenever that was and I I I

3351
02:20:21,760 --> 02:20:25,760
was getting frustrated watching all

3352
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:28,359
these stories because I kept thinking

3353
02:20:25,760 --> 02:20:31,920
this is not the answer to why Starbucks

3354
02:20:28,359 --> 02:20:34,720
worked these are these one-off anecdotes

3355
02:20:31,920 --> 02:20:36,680
that are sure they're emblematic of some

3356
02:20:34,720 --> 02:20:39,040
broader theme but at the end of the day

3357
02:20:36,680 --> 02:20:41,120
like the answer to why Starbucks Works

3358
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:42,520
has to be something about the business

3359
02:20:41,120 --> 02:20:44,760
model and every time you walk into the

3360
02:20:42,520 --> 02:20:47,520
store XYZ happens and here's the

3361
02:20:44,760 --> 02:20:50,160
economics but it turns out there are

3362
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:52,479
thousands of these stories and it's the

3363
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:54,000
humanity seeping through and it's hard

3364
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:55,680
for the company to tell the story

3365
02:20:54,000 --> 02:20:57,560
because everyone just feels like a

3366
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,319
random oneoff example but they're

3367
02:20:57,560 --> 02:21:01,560
happening in every community in every

3368
02:20:59,319 --> 02:21:04,880
part of the country and I think that is

3369
02:21:01,560 --> 02:21:06,760
the for me as like a business historian

3370
02:21:04,880 --> 02:21:07,960
that's been the thing that jumps out is

3371
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:10,600
there's no other company that we've

3372
02:21:07,960 --> 02:21:12,319
studied that has this sort of obsession

3373
02:21:10,600 --> 02:21:14,960
with people and Humanity the way that

3374
02:21:12,319 --> 02:21:18,120
that Starbucks does and we're not

3375
02:21:14,960 --> 02:21:20,080
perfect and so we do make mistakes and

3376
02:21:18,120 --> 02:21:23,240
when you're when the brand is being

3377
02:21:20,080 --> 02:21:25,080
shined so brightly it's a high standard

3378
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:27,160
to be held to we live in an environment

3379
02:21:25,080 --> 02:21:29,479
where if you do make a mistake and we

3380
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:32,800
are human we're going to make mistakes

3381
02:21:29,479 --> 02:21:35,280
unfortunately that becomes the thing yep

3382
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:37,800
uh and it's tough to fight that are you

3383
02:21:35,280 --> 02:21:40,680
open I'd love to kind of Flash Forward

3384
02:21:37,800 --> 02:21:44,240
uh you know you were CEO through 2017

3385
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:47,040
Kevin Johnson took over 2017 to 2022 you

3386
02:21:44,240 --> 02:21:49,479
came back for one year as interim CEO

3387
02:21:47,040 --> 02:21:51,520
and now laxman is the the CEO and has

3388
02:21:49,479 --> 02:21:55,000
been in the seat for about a year

3389
02:21:51,520 --> 02:21:56,960
um you came in after a tumultuous Co era

3390
02:21:55,000 --> 02:21:58,640
and and tried to basically figure out

3391
02:21:56,960 --> 02:22:00,120
who the successor was going to be and

3392
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:03,479
and you know patch the ship in the

3393
02:22:00,120 --> 02:22:05,760
meantime a lot of stuff has has happened

3394
02:22:03,479 --> 02:22:08,080
in that last five years notably with

3395
02:22:05,760 --> 02:22:09,560
labor unions I don't want to make this a

3396
02:22:08,080 --> 02:22:11,640
podcast about labor unions but I do want

3397
02:22:09,560 --> 02:22:14,560
to ask you what have you learned from

3398
02:22:11,640 --> 02:22:16,560
the experience of you know having to do

3399
02:22:14,560 --> 02:22:21,520
a deep dive into how we got

3400
02:22:16,560 --> 02:22:23,479
here that's a very tough comp comp Lex

3401
02:22:21,520 --> 02:22:25,319
question

3402
02:22:23,479 --> 02:22:27,479
uh I

3403
02:22:25,319 --> 02:22:30,200
think

3404
02:22:27,479 --> 02:22:34,000
my personal

3405
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:37,640
relationship with the company and

3406
02:22:34,000 --> 02:22:41,840
how personal it is to me and the things

3407
02:22:37,640 --> 02:22:43,520
that we not I but we have tried to do to

3408
02:22:41,840 --> 02:22:48,840
build a different kind of

3409
02:22:43,520 --> 02:22:53,479
company uh when the country started

3410
02:22:48,840 --> 02:22:54,680
moving in a postco era to a direction

3411
02:22:53,479 --> 02:22:58,840
that I didn't

3412
02:22:54,680 --> 02:23:03,000
recognize very very hard to

3413
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:04,880
understand why Starbucks would be under

3414
02:23:03,000 --> 02:23:07,800
assault or

3415
02:23:04,880 --> 02:23:10,080
or just being challenged this

3416
02:23:07,800 --> 02:23:13,240
way particularly when you had built a

3417
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:15,279
reputation on a very pattern in a

3418
02:23:13,240 --> 02:23:17,840
history of being

3419
02:23:15,279 --> 02:23:19,439
unbelievably kind to your people yes

3420
02:23:17,840 --> 02:23:22,920
yeah I

3421
02:23:19,439 --> 02:23:25,439
entered Starbucks as the interim CEO

3422
02:23:22,920 --> 02:23:29,359
when this was already going on and I

3423
02:23:25,439 --> 02:23:31,680
think the company made some early

3424
02:23:29,359 --> 02:23:34,479
mistakes some of which were covid

3425
02:23:31,680 --> 02:23:37,200
related again no textbook had to deal

3426
02:23:34,479 --> 02:23:41,040
with covid issues health issues safety

3427
02:23:37,200 --> 02:23:44,840
issues uh and then I think uh

3428
02:23:41,040 --> 02:23:47,640
underestimated the ground swell

3429
02:23:44,840 --> 02:23:51,640
of public

3430
02:23:47,640 --> 02:23:54,080
sentiment uh for this movement in

3431
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:57,399
America and

3432
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:58,880
um then became vilified for trying to

3433
02:23:57,399 --> 02:24:00,040
defend the company in a way that I

3434
02:23:58,880 --> 02:24:02,920
thought was

3435
02:24:00,040 --> 02:24:05,840
appropriate um I think what's lost in

3436
02:24:02,920 --> 02:24:08,960
all this is the percentage of stores

3437
02:24:05,840 --> 02:24:11,080
that have been petitioned and the number

3438
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:14,080
of people is very small in relationship

3439
02:24:11,080 --> 02:24:16,279
to the to the whole and then all of the

3440
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:20,640
people in Starbucks who were depending

3441
02:24:16,279 --> 02:24:25,359
on me to defend the company and trying

3442
02:24:20,640 --> 02:24:27,720
to do that in a world of disinformation

3443
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:29,840
is very difficult at the time when I was

3444
02:24:27,720 --> 02:24:33,760
trying to restore the company back to

3445
02:24:29,840 --> 02:24:35,600
health clearly mistakes were made this

3446
02:24:33,760 --> 02:24:39,160
story is still

3447
02:24:35,600 --> 02:24:41,359
unfolding and um my heart's with the

3448
02:24:39,160 --> 02:24:44,920
company and but the thing that I think

3449
02:24:41,359 --> 02:24:48,399
was lost in the story is the shareholder

3450
02:24:44,920 --> 02:24:50,600
is not the primary person it's the

3451
02:24:48,399 --> 02:24:53,439
Starbucks partner in the green apron

3452
02:24:50,600 --> 02:24:55,960
which is the cloth of the company and if

3453
02:24:53,439 --> 02:24:57,279
we exceed the expectations of the cloth

3454
02:24:55,960 --> 02:24:58,520
of the company and our people

3455
02:24:57,279 --> 02:25:00,800
shareholders and customers are going to

3456
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:03,200
win that's been my whole life story and

3457
02:25:00,800 --> 02:25:05,680
that's basically worked for decades and

3458
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:07,560
decades it also seems like when you

3459
02:25:05,680 --> 02:25:11,399
Starbucks has become such an institution

3460
02:25:07,560 --> 02:25:12,560
in our society that leading a small

3461
02:25:11,399 --> 02:25:14,479
disruptive

3462
02:25:12,560 --> 02:25:16,399
organization everyone gives you the

3463
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:18,000
credit for all the positives and all the

3464
02:25:16,399 --> 02:25:20,520
exciting things you're doing and you

3465
02:25:18,000 --> 02:25:22,160
sort of get a pass on anything that

3466
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:25,439
didn't work move F break things when

3467
02:25:22,160 --> 02:25:28,479
you're at this scale everyone expects

3468
02:25:25,439 --> 02:25:30,479
you to be wildly successful all the time

3469
02:25:28,479 --> 02:25:32,680
because you always have been but

3470
02:25:30,479 --> 02:25:34,479
anything that's misaligned that is where

3471
02:25:32,680 --> 02:25:37,439
100% of the focus

3472
02:25:34,479 --> 02:25:39,319
is well I think if you take a step back

3473
02:25:37,439 --> 02:25:42,720
not from Starbucks but if you say to

3474
02:25:39,319 --> 02:25:47,040
yourself what company has gotten big in

3475
02:25:42,720 --> 02:25:48,680
the food business and stayed true to its

3476
02:25:47,040 --> 02:25:50,760
core purpose and reason for being and

3477
02:25:48,680 --> 02:25:54,160
then stayed positively

3478
02:25:50,760 --> 02:25:56,800
inclined to its

3479
02:25:54,160 --> 02:26:00,279
customers what are you going to name and

3480
02:25:56,800 --> 02:26:03,000
so the odds on getting this big and

3481
02:26:00,279 --> 02:26:06,720
still being revered for who you once

3482
02:26:03,000 --> 02:26:09,240
were is very very difficult and I would

3483
02:26:06,720 --> 02:26:11,680
argue in so many ways we are better

3484
02:26:09,240 --> 02:26:13,920
today than we were when we were smaller

3485
02:26:11,680 --> 02:26:17,200
that is expected of

3486
02:26:13,920 --> 02:26:19,359
us uh but I don't think we get much

3487
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,880
credit maybe we shouldn't maybe this is

3488
02:26:19,359 --> 02:26:22,720
uh our

3489
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:24,960
responsibility the elements the

3490
02:26:22,720 --> 02:26:27,359
characteristics that built the Starbucks

3491
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:30,399
business the culture is compassion

3492
02:26:27,359 --> 02:26:33,720
empathy and love those are not just

3493
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:35,960
words it's like real things that are not

3494
02:26:33,720 --> 02:26:38,319
they're not being taught in Business

3495
02:26:35,960 --> 02:26:40,840
Schools and people on the outside view

3496
02:26:38,319 --> 02:26:43,840
it is not true I'm telling you the

3497
02:26:40,840 --> 02:26:47,080
reason we've succeeded is because the

3498
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:51,000
underpinning of the company's purpose

3499
02:26:47,080 --> 02:26:55,479
has been just that and it's much harder

3500
02:26:51,000 --> 02:26:57,560
today to to execute that because you're

3501
02:26:55,479 --> 02:27:00,160
you're dealing with cynicism as the

3502
02:26:57,560 --> 02:27:02,120
first order of defense that you have to

3503
02:27:00,160 --> 02:27:05,240
overcome but the

3504
02:27:02,120 --> 02:27:07,840
responsibility as Leaders is to do just

3505
02:27:05,240 --> 02:27:10,240
that all right I'm going to take us to

3506
02:27:07,840 --> 02:27:13,720
Starbucks today and I'll kind of map

3507
02:27:10,240 --> 02:27:15,479
that out and give you the stats and then

3508
02:27:13,720 --> 02:27:17,720
we're going to go into Playbook where we

3509
02:27:15,479 --> 02:27:19,560
basically try to take all the lessons we

3510
02:27:17,720 --> 02:27:22,319
just learned over the last few hours and

3511
02:27:19,560 --> 02:27:24,160
figure out why did Starbucks work um and

3512
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:26,399
at such a grand scale that it did so to

3513
02:27:24,160 --> 02:27:30,680
catch listeners up on the business today

3514
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:34,160
Starbucks does 36 billion in Revenue 4.1

3515
02:27:30,680 --> 02:27:36,439
billion in net income there are 380,000

3516
02:27:34,160 --> 02:27:39,920
employees you gave me a stat I think

3517
02:27:36,439 --> 02:27:42,399
over 4 450,000 450,000 I must be using

3518
02:27:39,920 --> 02:27:44,240
an old number um and over the lifetime

3519
02:27:42,399 --> 02:27:47,040
of the company has employed over 5

3520
02:27:44,240 --> 02:27:51,479
million yes 5 million alone that a scale

3521
02:27:47,040 --> 02:27:53,920
right there 39,000 stores globally in 86

3522
02:27:51,479 --> 02:27:58,760
countries almost half of which are in

3523
02:27:53,920 --> 02:28:02,399
North America 18% in China and uh about

3524
02:27:58,760 --> 02:28:04,680
half of those are licensed franchise and

3525
02:28:02,399 --> 02:28:06,800
half are company operated and so while

3526
02:28:04,680 --> 02:28:08,479
we're not you know you you mentioned we

3527
02:28:06,800 --> 02:28:10,359
don't franchise in the traditional

3528
02:28:08,479 --> 02:28:12,800
McDonald's sense you do these joint

3529
02:28:10,359 --> 02:28:15,479
ventures and you do this uh this way of

3530
02:28:12,800 --> 02:28:17,520
entering countries where you don't need

3531
02:28:15,479 --> 02:28:20,479
to own and operate the entire store

3532
02:28:17,520 --> 02:28:22,479
yourself then not franchises in the ipal

3533
02:28:20,479 --> 02:28:24,880
sense yeah so tell us about I think we

3534
02:28:22,479 --> 02:28:27,600
should talk about that yeah the joint

3535
02:28:24,880 --> 02:28:29,920
venture relationships that we've

3536
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:32,000
established and some goes back almost 30

3537
02:28:29,920 --> 02:28:35,520
years in the Middle

3538
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:37,680
East in Latin and Central America now in

3539
02:28:35,520 --> 02:28:39,479
Italy in the

3540
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:41,479
EU in

3541
02:28:39,479 --> 02:28:45,000
India and what does it mean to be your

3542
02:28:41,479 --> 02:28:47,040
partner so uh every country is different

3543
02:28:45,000 --> 02:28:48,760
depending on the economics of that

3544
02:28:47,040 --> 02:28:52,680
country the political

3545
02:28:48,760 --> 02:28:55,760
issues um some countries have been an

3546
02:28:52,680 --> 02:28:59,279
8020 Starbucks owns 80 they own 20 some

3547
02:28:55,760 --> 02:29:01,640
are 5050 some are some of the 8020

3548
02:28:59,279 --> 02:29:04,920
started out as 80 for us and they bought

3549
02:29:01,640 --> 02:29:07,160
it in over the way uh it depends so but

3550
02:29:04,920 --> 02:29:09,600
the the key thing is whether it's

3551
02:29:07,160 --> 02:29:11,760
Alberto torado Latin and Central America

3552
02:29:09,600 --> 02:29:14,399
Muhammad alai in the Middle East the

3553
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:18,720
Tata group in India the prasi family in

3554
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:21,040
in in Italy they understand the culture

3555
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:22,680
and values of Starbucks

3556
02:29:21,040 --> 02:29:24,680
and so

3557
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:27,080
tactically what you know you said it's

3558
02:29:24,680 --> 02:29:29,800
not a franchise in the traditional way

3559
02:29:27,080 --> 02:29:31,920
what are Starbucks responsible for and

3560
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:34,760
what is the partner responsible for

3561
02:29:31,920 --> 02:29:38,080
Starbucks is responsible for roasting

3562
02:29:34,760 --> 02:29:40,319
the coffee MH for all the recipes which

3563
02:29:38,080 --> 02:29:43,120
are consistent with Starbucks

3564
02:29:40,319 --> 02:29:45,000
worldwide a co-design to the store where

3565
02:29:43,120 --> 02:29:47,399
we're designing the store with the JV or

3566
02:29:45,000 --> 02:29:51,279
the licensed partner and they control

3567
02:29:47,399 --> 02:29:53,840
all the operations h and so all of

3568
02:29:51,279 --> 02:29:56,080
Starbucks's franchise or license stores

3569
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:58,319
are done in this way where there's a

3570
02:29:56,080 --> 02:30:01,479
partner in a country yes that there not

3571
02:29:58,319 --> 02:30:04,920
no individual licens franchises of any

3572
02:30:01,479 --> 02:30:08,160
kind unless it's certain real estate

3573
02:30:04,920 --> 02:30:11,840
that we can't get uh that we want access

3574
02:30:08,160 --> 02:30:14,520
to like the a roadway uh on a highway in

3575
02:30:11,840 --> 02:30:16,560
Switzerland or something odd see and

3576
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:19,160
airports are this way right airports are

3577
02:30:16,560 --> 02:30:22,120
Master licensed with the with the master

3578
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:24,640
licy like Whoever has it in like

3579
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:27,000
Marriott or whoever has it I gotcha or

3580
02:30:24,640 --> 02:30:30,880
Target that has 2,000 Starbucks stores

3581
02:30:27,000 --> 02:30:33,200
and those are Target Opera yes I see and

3582
02:30:30,880 --> 02:30:36,080
great partner and Brian Cornell great

3583
02:30:33,200 --> 02:30:38,359
guy and it's interesting the basically

3584
02:30:36,080 --> 02:30:42,520
you know half of Starbucks stores look

3585
02:30:38,359 --> 02:30:44,760
like the platonic ideal of coming out of

3586
02:30:42,520 --> 02:30:47,080
the Starbucks HQ here's how we imagine

3587
02:30:44,760 --> 02:30:50,319
this this store to be and half of them

3588
02:30:47,080 --> 02:30:52,160
are there's some reason why we alone

3589
02:30:50,319 --> 02:30:53,520
can't do this and need a partner and you

3590
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:55,920
you know

3591
02:30:53,520 --> 02:30:58,720
you I mean ideally want the customer

3592
02:30:55,920 --> 02:31:00,160
experience to be the same worldwide

3593
02:30:58,720 --> 02:31:01,920
regardless of the shape and size of the

3594
02:31:00,160 --> 02:31:03,680
store where it's located makes sense

3595
02:31:01,920 --> 02:31:06,040
which is not always the case I I admit

3596
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:08,120
that so one market that we haven't

3597
02:31:06,040 --> 02:31:10,080
talked about that I I want to ask you

3598
02:31:08,120 --> 02:31:13,800
about while we're in this then we'll get

3599
02:31:10,080 --> 02:31:16,960
to Playbook is Italy yeah the whole

3600
02:31:13,800 --> 02:31:20,000
thing came out of Milan right and yet

3601
02:31:16,960 --> 02:31:23,800
for decades 50 years no Starbucks 50

3602
02:31:20,000 --> 02:31:26,880
years no no Starbucks in Italy and the

3603
02:31:23,800 --> 02:31:29,040
belief at least as I see it is they've

3604
02:31:26,880 --> 02:31:30,840
perfected the coffee house concept don't

3605
02:31:29,040 --> 02:31:34,399
bring an imitation in

3606
02:31:30,840 --> 02:31:36,000
here yeah but it's worked it's it's

3607
02:31:34,399 --> 02:31:37,279
working phenomenally well why is

3608
02:31:36,000 --> 02:31:40,560
Starbucks being so well-received in

3609
02:31:37,279 --> 02:31:44,080
Italy so I I know I'm going to

3610
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:45,200
be chastised for what I'm about to say

3611
02:31:44,080 --> 02:31:49,359
but it's

3612
02:31:45,200 --> 02:31:51,160
true the by and large coffee in Italy is

3613
02:31:49,359 --> 02:31:53,880
not as good as it once

3614
02:31:51,160 --> 02:31:56,359
was there are certain coffee companies

3615
02:31:53,880 --> 02:31:58,800
that have maintained the standard but by

3616
02:31:56,359 --> 02:32:01,800
and large the coffee is not as good I'm

3617
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:03,880
going to be killed for that but that's

3618
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:05,240
that's that's my truth if you don't

3619
02:32:03,880 --> 02:32:09,120
believe you have a better product who

3620
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:12,920
does yeah but I I didn't think we earned

3621
02:32:09,120 --> 02:32:16,120
the right to go to Italy until we were

3622
02:32:12,920 --> 02:32:18,359
really ready to present ourselves in the

3623
02:32:16,120 --> 02:32:20,479
best possible way because I knew the

3624
02:32:18,359 --> 02:32:22,680
knives would be out for us and ways that

3625
02:32:20,479 --> 02:32:25,359
we could couldn't even possibly imagine

3626
02:32:22,680 --> 02:32:27,960
given the the history and the cultural

3627
02:32:25,359 --> 02:32:30,120
relevance of espresso in the coffee bar

3628
02:32:27,960 --> 02:32:32,160
and so we waited and waited and waited

3629
02:32:30,120 --> 02:32:35,359
until The

3630
02:32:32,160 --> 02:32:37,080
Roastery and so I before we get to Italy

3631
02:32:35,359 --> 02:32:38,680
I have to explain The Roastery for you

3632
02:32:37,080 --> 02:32:40,640
please I mean the first time I went in

3633
02:32:38,680 --> 02:32:42,520
there you know kidney candy store wide

3634
02:32:40,640 --> 02:32:46,520
eyes so there are six roasteries

3635
02:32:42,520 --> 02:32:49,840
starting in Seattle Chicago New York

3636
02:32:46,520 --> 02:32:53,359
Tokyo Shanghai and Milan the road

3637
02:32:49,840 --> 02:32:56,160
Roastery itself is probably the most

3638
02:32:53,359 --> 02:32:58,920
entrepreneurial creative

3639
02:32:56,160 --> 02:32:59,960
project that I could recall in my

3640
02:32:58,920 --> 02:33:02,279
history of

3641
02:32:59,960 --> 02:33:05,200
Starbucks what is the experience we

3642
02:33:02,279 --> 02:33:07,800
could create that just absolutely blows

3643
02:33:05,200 --> 02:33:12,279
people away so what did I

3644
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:15,800
do as a kid I've Loved this

3645
02:33:12,279 --> 02:33:18,800
movie and so I invited the most creative

3646
02:33:15,800 --> 02:33:20,960
people in the company to my house and I

3647
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:23,080
said we're going to watch a movie

3648
02:33:20,960 --> 02:33:25,920
of course they thought I was nuts and I

3649
02:33:23,080 --> 02:33:28,080
turn on Willie Wonka I was say got to be

3650
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:31,560
turn on Wily W Wonka with Gene

3651
02:33:28,080 --> 02:33:32,920
Wilder and we went to work starting to

3652
02:33:31,560 --> 02:33:35,920
design a

3653
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:37,399
space now we realized early on and this

3654
02:33:35,920 --> 02:33:41,279
was what

3655
02:33:37,399 --> 02:33:43,600
2013 eight years ago now we realized

3656
02:33:41,279 --> 02:33:46,760
economically this is a tough business

3657
02:33:43,600 --> 02:33:50,080
model so what are we trying to do we're

3658
02:33:46,760 --> 02:33:53,800
trying to create an experience that is a

3659
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:56,000
to the brand and significantly elevat

3660
02:33:53,800 --> 02:33:59,399
Starbucks which is fighting ubiquity all

3661
02:33:56,000 --> 02:34:03,439
the time every day and

3662
02:33:59,399 --> 02:34:06,240
so we created this 30,000 foot space in

3663
02:34:03,439 --> 02:34:09,319
Seattle which we opened seven years ago

3664
02:34:06,240 --> 02:34:11,319
which is the most

3665
02:34:09,319 --> 02:34:15,359
dynamic

3666
02:34:11,319 --> 02:34:18,760
entertaining vehicle of theater romance

3667
02:34:15,359 --> 02:34:21,160
seduction and we open it to rave reviews

3668
02:34:18,760 --> 02:34:23,439
and we're manufact facturing like Willie

3669
02:34:21,160 --> 02:34:26,040
Wonka did were manufacturing and

3670
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:27,359
roasting coffee in the space which makes

3671
02:34:26,040 --> 02:34:31,479
the smell of

3672
02:34:27,359 --> 02:34:33,720
the so we open it up and then over time

3673
02:34:31,479 --> 02:34:35,960
we started opening a couple more we get

3674
02:34:33,720 --> 02:34:38,279
approval from the Chinese government to

3675
02:34:35,960 --> 02:34:40,960
manufacturer in the center of Shanghai

3676
02:34:38,279 --> 02:34:44,040
we open up a 40,000 foot in Shanghai we

3677
02:34:40,960 --> 02:34:45,720
open up an incredible space in Tokyo we

3678
02:34:44,040 --> 02:34:47,439
open up in the old Craton Barrel space

3679
02:34:45,720 --> 02:34:50,040
in North Michigan Avenue in

3680
02:34:47,439 --> 02:34:52,840
Chicago we open up in the me packing

3681
02:34:50,040 --> 02:34:55,359
business in New York but the

3682
02:34:52,840 --> 02:34:56,920
shrine has to be Milan this is the way

3683
02:34:55,359 --> 02:34:58,160
to go back and this is the way we open

3684
02:34:56,920 --> 02:35:02,319
on Italy

3685
02:34:58,160 --> 02:35:04,680
now our partner in Italy is the prasi

3686
02:35:02,319 --> 02:35:06,720
family fantastic people who are in the

3687
02:35:04,680 --> 02:35:08,640
real estate business and they are

3688
02:35:06,720 --> 02:35:10,160
showing me I'm going back and forth to

3689
02:35:08,640 --> 02:35:11,720

3690
02:35:10,160 --> 02:35:13,720
got real estate and I got to see it I

3691
02:35:11,720 --> 02:35:16,600

3692
02:35:13,720 --> 02:35:18,600
going back and back and back no not the

3693
02:35:16,600 --> 02:35:20,479
right sight not the right sight and I'm

3694
02:35:18,600 --> 02:35:24,399
standing

3695
02:35:20,479 --> 02:35:26,800
on the corner of of cardo square and I

3696
02:35:24,399 --> 02:35:30,800
look at this face and I say what about

3697
02:35:26,800 --> 02:35:32,560
that and he says that's the post office

3698
02:35:30,800 --> 02:35:36,680

3706
02:35:47,359 --> 02:35:52,080
empty

3707
02:35:48,279 --> 02:35:53,720
space and find out the story is that

3708
02:35:52,080 --> 02:35:56,640
these government buildings during the

3709
02:35:53,720 --> 02:35:59,240
financial crisis were sold to private

3710
02:35:56,640 --> 02:36:02,399

02:36:03,920 --> 02:36:06,359
private Equity that's letting real

3714
02:36:05,040 --> 02:36:09,560

out I know I'm going to get killed for

3717
02:36:10,920 --> 02:36:18,399

3718
02:36:13,200 --> 02:36:22,200

3729
02:36:46,319 --> 02:36:51,640
we John Gray of course being the number

3730
02:36:47,720 --> 02:36:54,319
two person at Blackstone so uh and

3731
02:36:51,640 --> 02:36:56,240
John's a big fan of Starbucks he had

3732
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:58,080
previously been in Seattle for a wedding

3733
02:36:56,240 --> 02:36:59,720
or bar mitzvah something and saw The

3734
02:36:58,080 --> 02:37:03,000
Roastery he knew exactly what I was

3735
02:36:59,720 --> 02:37:06,920
talking about and so that is how we

3736
02:37:03,000 --> 02:37:09,840
entered in Milan now we have 30 stores

3737
02:37:06,920 --> 02:37:11,479
we have 30 traditional stores in Italy

3738
02:37:09,840 --> 02:37:14,080
did they already exist before the roas

3739
02:37:11,479 --> 02:37:16,640
open open first first the roas then 30

3740
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:21,520
stores in we're in Milan we're in Rome

3741
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:21,520
and we're in Florence and um

3742
02:37:23,240 --> 02:37:26,560
two three years

3743
02:37:24,560 --> 02:37:27,520
later what do you think the number one

3744
02:37:26,560 --> 02:37:29,640
beverage

3745
02:37:27,520 --> 02:37:32,359
is it's

3746
02:37:29,640 --> 02:37:34,359
espresso for Starbucks yeah straight

3747
02:37:32,359 --> 02:37:37,359
espresso espresso is the number one

3748
02:37:34,359 --> 02:37:39,520
beverage wow wow and so we're I don't

3749
02:37:37,359 --> 02:37:41,800
take the the success in Italy for

3750
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:44,439
granted we've got to continue to earn it

3751
02:37:41,800 --> 02:37:46,479
but what I'm most proud of is that we've

3752
02:37:44,439 --> 02:37:49,520
respected the Italian people and Coffee

3753
02:37:46,479 --> 02:37:51,560
Culture for 50 years and they they

3754
02:37:49,520 --> 02:37:52,880
embraced us and so the implication of

3755
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:54,600
espresso being the number one beverage

3756
02:37:52,880 --> 02:37:56,439
is it's not tourists it's the Italians

3757
02:37:54,600 --> 02:37:57,880
coming to Starbucks there's a lot of

3758
02:37:56,439 --> 02:37:59,200
tourists coming into The Roastery but

3759
02:37:57,880 --> 02:38:01,960
yes it's and that they're choosing to

3760
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:05,000
get their espresso at Starbucks not it

3761
02:38:01,960 --> 02:38:07,600
yeah yeah so I so and you know Italy I'm

3762
02:38:05,000 --> 02:38:12,000
going to Italy I think next week but

3763
02:38:07,600 --> 02:38:15,160
just for me the the the gratification

3764
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:16,800
the satisfaction of you know complete

3765
02:38:15,160 --> 02:38:20,279
full circle from

3766
02:38:16,800 --> 02:38:23,600
1983 is just beyond belief from

3767
02:38:20,279 --> 02:38:26,640
I'm wondering another backdrop to The

3768
02:38:23,600 --> 02:38:29,240
Roastery and really throughout all the

3769
02:38:26,640 --> 02:38:32,200
2010s must have been third wave

3770
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:36,319
coffee and I'm sure it was on your radar

3771
02:38:32,200 --> 02:38:37,840
screen yes at the same time it doesn't

3772
02:38:36,319 --> 02:38:40,200
seem like it's ever made a dent in

3773
02:38:37,840 --> 02:38:42,160
Starbucks there's always been stories

3774
02:38:40,200 --> 02:38:45,720
that all these competitors were going to

3775
02:38:42,160 --> 02:38:48,960
steal business from Starbucks but from

3776
02:38:45,720 --> 02:38:50,760
1983 to all the way today the

3777
02:38:48,960 --> 02:38:53,520
consumption of especially coffee is

3778
02:38:50,760 --> 02:38:55,920
still a small amount relative to the

3779
02:38:53,520 --> 02:38:58,319
macro opportunity so all those people

3780
02:38:55,920 --> 02:39:00,640
have expanded the market with and for

3781
02:38:58,319 --> 02:39:03,000
Starbucks now we created an industry

3782
02:39:00,640 --> 02:39:05,520
that didn't exist and they have followed

3783
02:39:03,000 --> 02:39:07,920
us and done really good things but we're

3784
02:39:05,520 --> 02:39:10,920
not threatened by that interesting so

3785
02:39:07,920 --> 02:39:14,200
you think third wave coffee brought

3786
02:39:10,920 --> 02:39:16,240
consumers into the Coffee Culture Market

3787
02:39:14,200 --> 02:39:17,640
yes that have then also become Starbucks

3788
02:39:16,240 --> 02:39:20,000
consumers and maybe they wouldn't have

3789
02:39:17,640 --> 02:39:22,479
been coffeee culture consumers at all

3790
02:39:20,000 --> 02:39:23,920
yes H how do you define third wave

3791
02:39:22,479 --> 02:39:25,279
coffee actually Howard is probably the

3792
02:39:23,920 --> 02:39:27,840
best person to ask I

3793
02:39:25,279 --> 02:39:31,960
mean it's a

3794
02:39:27,840 --> 02:39:35,439
very uh intentional independent coffee

3795
02:39:31,960 --> 02:39:38,120
store that is small enough that they're

3796
02:39:35,439 --> 02:39:40,840
roasting their own coffee or getting

3797
02:39:38,120 --> 02:39:44,240
coffee from a small proprietary roaster

3798
02:39:40,840 --> 02:39:47,160
M and creating a very

3799
02:39:44,240 --> 02:39:50,439
unique handcrafted

3800
02:39:47,160 --> 02:39:53,880
experience uh that in many ways

3801
02:39:50,439 --> 02:39:56,000
Starbucks can't do in scale right right

3802
02:39:53,880 --> 02:39:57,920
and so I I tip my hat to them but

3803
02:39:56,000 --> 02:40:01,040
there's no coffee experience in the

3804
02:39:57,920 --> 02:40:03,640
world that comes close to The Roastery

3805
02:40:01,040 --> 02:40:05,520
any of them and do those roasteries

3806
02:40:03,640 --> 02:40:07,200
Break Even or are they this like

3807
02:40:05,520 --> 02:40:08,640
marketing show piece that loses some

3808
02:40:07,200 --> 02:40:11,439
have some are making money and some

3809
02:40:08,640 --> 02:40:13,760
aren't wow I mean but I don't I you I

3810
02:40:11,439 --> 02:40:15,760
don't I've never viewed it that way

3811
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:18,600
Billboards it's it's you can't you

3812
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:20,120
couldn't put a price on the hundreds of

3813
02:40:18,600 --> 02:40:22,160
thousands of people that come into this

3814
02:40:20,120 --> 02:40:24,760
Roastery and have an experience of a

3815
02:40:22,160 --> 02:40:27,880
lifetime and I took Mr Arno Through The

3816
02:40:24,760 --> 02:40:30,680
Roastery really did yeah in Milan in

3817
02:40:27,880 --> 02:40:32,840
Seattle Seattle he and his son yeah wow

3818
02:40:30,680 --> 02:40:34,399
yeah spent a good amount of time with

3819
02:40:32,840 --> 02:40:37,040
him I've taken a lot

3820
02:40:34,399 --> 02:40:40,120
of of retail

3821
02:40:37,040 --> 02:40:42,439
CEOs and iconic business people through

3822
02:40:40,120 --> 02:40:45,520
the roas strey I bet who have who want

3823
02:40:42,439 --> 02:40:47,640
to see it wow wow what was Bernard doing

3824
02:40:45,520 --> 02:40:49,040
in Seattle I don't know what he was

3825
02:40:47,640 --> 02:40:50,479
doing in Seattle but I spent a feir

3826
02:40:49,040 --> 02:40:53,760
around time with him and his son the son

3827
02:40:50,479 --> 02:40:56,640
now runs Tiffany oh great wow and he his

3828
02:40:53,760 --> 02:40:58,560
level of curiosity was uh very high I

3829
02:40:56,640 --> 02:41:01,279
remember he was he kept looking at the

3830
02:40:58,560 --> 02:41:03,200
leather railing and the stitching and I

3831
02:41:01,279 --> 02:41:04,000
just said you spending a lot of time on

3832
02:41:03,200 --> 02:41:06,600
the

3833
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:08,920
leather how bet he was maybe there's a

3834
02:41:06,600 --> 02:41:11,920
partnership to be

3835
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:14,000
done um okay so now the the question

3836
02:41:11,920 --> 02:41:16,120
sort of becomes what are the setum

3837
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:19,359
circumstances that had to be true in

3838
02:41:16,120 --> 02:41:21,680
order for Starbucks today to exist and

3839
02:41:19,359 --> 02:41:25,520
the one thing we haven't talked about or

3840
02:41:21,680 --> 02:41:27,880
one of the things is how much of what

3841
02:41:25,520 --> 02:41:31,279
Starbucks has accomplished could have

3842
02:41:27,880 --> 02:41:33,359
happened if it wasn't an addictive

3843
02:41:31,279 --> 02:41:37,720
substance like it's kind of this

3844
02:41:33,359 --> 02:41:39,560
incredible thing that it's a legal drug

3845
02:41:37,720 --> 02:41:41,760
that all the research anyone's ever done

3846
02:41:39,560 --> 02:41:44,439
into caffeine is by and large it's

3847
02:41:41,760 --> 02:41:47,479
neutral to helpful and like every other

3848
02:41:44,439 --> 02:41:49,399
drug that you know at some point people

3849
02:41:47,479 --> 02:41:51,359
have enjoyed whether it's smoking we

3850
02:41:49,399 --> 02:41:53,600
drinking more as research comes out over

3851
02:41:51,359 --> 02:41:56,040
time we find out shoot that wasn't good

3852
02:41:53,600 --> 02:41:57,560
for us that's not the case for coffee

3853
02:41:56,040 --> 02:42:00,560
what an amazing thing to get to build a

3854
02:41:57,560 --> 02:42:01,800
business on this delightful thing we

3855
02:42:00,560 --> 02:42:03,120
have to consume every day because we're

3856
02:42:01,800 --> 02:42:06,760
addicted and it's pretty good for us and

3857
02:42:03,120 --> 02:42:08,359
it gives you superpowers yeah I I'd like

3858
02:42:06,760 --> 02:42:12,319
to

3859
02:42:08,359 --> 02:42:15,359
believe it's not based on what you are

3860
02:42:12,319 --> 02:42:18,200
characterizing as an addictive beverage

3861
02:42:15,359 --> 02:42:20,520
I'd like to believe it's the experience

3862
02:42:18,200 --> 02:42:22,439
that has been created

3863
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:24,040
around the enjoyment of the coffee and

3864
02:42:22,439 --> 02:42:27,680
the experience that

3865
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:29,240
happens uh I also think and we we

3866
02:42:27,680 --> 02:42:34,680
haven't really spoke that much about it

3867
02:42:29,240 --> 02:42:38,040
is I can't State enough over the last

3868
02:42:34,680 --> 02:42:40,800
two decades what customization meant to

3869
02:42:38,040 --> 02:42:44,720
the company and how

3870
02:42:40,800 --> 02:42:47,439
customers created a personal beverage

3871
02:42:44,720 --> 02:42:50,160
well beyond what the menu was and I

3872
02:42:47,439 --> 02:42:53,760
don't know any other business yeah in

3873
02:42:50,160 --> 02:42:56,720
which the the incrementality of the

3874
02:42:53,760 --> 02:43:00,319
price has been dictated by the

3875
02:42:56,720 --> 02:43:03,840
consumer the base price is X but most

3876
02:43:00,319 --> 02:43:05,920
people are doing something in plus y i I

3877
02:43:03,840 --> 02:43:07,399
have a a very specific drink that I like

3878
02:43:05,920 --> 02:43:10,600
and when I go to coffee shops that are

3879
02:43:07,399 --> 02:43:12,840
not Starbucks I can't get it because it

3880
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:14,840
feels taboo to order like I like an iced

3881
02:43:12,840 --> 02:43:17,960
almond milk latte with whipped cream and

3882
02:43:14,840 --> 02:43:19,880
when I go to most coffee houses want I'm

3883
02:43:17,960 --> 02:43:21,080
like I can't ask for wh wh cream on top

3884
02:43:19,880 --> 02:43:22,880
of that but Starbucks they're like of

3885
02:43:21,080 --> 02:43:24,880
course that's what we do

3886
02:43:22,880 --> 02:43:26,720
here this is something that I think has

3887
02:43:24,880 --> 02:43:31,319
translated incredibly well to the mobile

3888
02:43:26,720 --> 02:43:33,080
app and that no other food company has

3889
02:43:31,319 --> 02:43:35,080
really the level of customization and I

3890
02:43:33,080 --> 02:43:38,920
think the mobile app

3891
02:43:35,080 --> 02:43:41,560
actually added velocity to customization

3892
02:43:38,920 --> 02:43:43,840
it powered

3893
02:43:41,560 --> 02:43:46,840
customization Y and I think the

3894
02:43:43,840 --> 02:43:50,520
Starbucks Barista deserves so much

3895
02:43:46,840 --> 02:43:54,000
credit because they are are dealing with

3896
02:43:50,520 --> 02:43:55,920
so many different variations of

3897
02:43:54,000 --> 02:43:58,640
beverages some of which they're making

3898
02:43:55,920 --> 02:44:01,520
for the first time on the

3899
02:43:58,640 --> 02:44:03,960
Fly hard to do it's a hard work it has

3900
02:44:01,520 --> 02:44:05,359
to be a good number because there's I

3901
02:44:03,960 --> 02:44:07,960
don't know if it's I haven't done the

3902
02:44:05,359 --> 02:44:11,160
math billions trillions of combinations

3903
02:44:07,960 --> 02:44:13,240
of possible drinks and so it has to be

3904
02:44:11,160 --> 02:44:15,720
every single day as a barista you making

3905
02:44:13,240 --> 02:44:18,279
something for the first time yes I think

3906
02:44:15,720 --> 02:44:20,560
I the the the number that people use

3907
02:44:18,279 --> 02:44:23,399
inside the compy is

3908
02:44:20,560 --> 02:44:26,279
100,000 different variations of

3909
02:44:23,399 --> 02:44:28,680
beverages that are being made

3910
02:44:26,279 --> 02:44:31,040
consistently a 100,000 different

3911
02:44:28,680 --> 02:44:34,200
beverages wow this is actually a really

3912
02:44:31,040 --> 02:44:36,600
interesting way to lead into Playbook

3913
02:44:34,200 --> 02:44:38,800
because on the surface it's like an

3914
02:44:36,600 --> 02:44:40,640
obvious question right like yes it's an

3915
02:44:38,800 --> 02:44:43,520
addictive substance caffeine is of

3916
02:44:40,640 --> 02:44:46,120
course on the other hand you're in a

3917
02:44:43,520 --> 02:44:48,160
highly competitive market right selling

3918
02:44:46,120 --> 02:44:49,560
a commodity and the market actually is

3919
02:44:48,160 --> 02:44:51,760
not just coffee

3920
02:44:49,560 --> 02:44:55,319
it's let's stick with this theme it's

3921
02:44:51,760 --> 02:44:57,120
caffeine broadly which there's Coca-Cola

3922
02:44:55,319 --> 02:44:59,560
there's peps there's you know well not

3923
02:44:57,120 --> 02:45:02,439
only that but every food company every

3924
02:44:59,560 --> 02:45:04,120
retail Food business from McDonald's on

3925
02:45:02,439 --> 02:45:05,920
yeah took a page out of Starbucks went

3926
02:45:04,120 --> 02:45:07,319
to school on us right put espresso

3927
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:10,160
machines in their stores and started

3928
02:45:07,319 --> 02:45:12,040
doing coffee beverages right that also

3929
02:45:10,160 --> 02:45:15,040
expanded the market and I think the real

3930
02:45:12,040 --> 02:45:17,760
question is for us here nobody has built

3931
02:45:15,040 --> 02:45:20,520
Starbucks despite decades in a highly

3932
02:45:17,760 --> 02:45:22,560
competitive market with whether it's

3933
02:45:20,520 --> 02:45:25,600
third wave or competitors in other

3934
02:45:22,560 --> 02:45:28,840
geographies or domestic competitors or

3935
02:45:25,600 --> 02:45:32,399
McDonald's getting into the business or

3936
02:45:28,840 --> 02:45:34,640
folders in Maxwell House there is a

3937
02:45:32,399 --> 02:45:37,120
unique tapestry that we've been weaving

3938
02:45:34,640 --> 02:45:40,279
throughout this episode that you know in

3939
02:45:37,120 --> 02:45:44,479
Hamilton Elmer's terms has power

3940
02:45:40,279 --> 02:45:49,960
here yes coffee so here's my second one

3941
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:53,439
in addition to the the um it's a but

3942
02:45:49,960 --> 02:45:56,840
delightful it is perceived to be

3943
02:45:53,439 --> 02:46:00,160
virtuous to be a barista where it is not

3944
02:45:56,840 --> 02:46:01,520
perceived to be virtuous to flip burgers

3945
02:46:00,160 --> 02:46:03,680
and I don't know if that's something

3946
02:46:01,520 --> 02:46:06,960
Starbucks created I don't know if that's

3947
02:46:03,680 --> 02:46:08,439
something inherent to the product I

3948
02:46:06,960 --> 02:46:11,200
don't know if that's because it has this

3949
02:46:08,439 --> 02:46:14,520
Italian lineage but there's all these

3950
02:46:11,200 --> 02:46:17,479
incredible benefits that Starbucks and

3951
02:46:14,520 --> 02:46:21,920
any other Coffee House chains get to

3952
02:46:17,479 --> 02:46:26,040
enjoy because because it's respected to

3953
02:46:21,920 --> 02:46:28,399
do that work and I'm curious why do you

3954
02:46:26,040 --> 02:46:31,240
think that's respected when similar ways

3955
02:46:28,399 --> 02:46:33,800
of spending your hours in restaurant

3956
02:46:31,240 --> 02:46:35,560
work isn't first of all I've never heard

3957
02:46:33,800 --> 02:46:38,319
it quite like that and I think that's a

3958
02:46:35,560 --> 02:46:42,000
very interesting

3959
02:46:38,319 --> 02:46:46,359
insight there is craft and

3960
02:46:42,000 --> 02:46:49,319
art to the expression of making the

3961
02:46:46,359 --> 02:46:53,520
beverage I also think the intimacy of

3962
02:46:49,319 --> 02:46:57,319
the relationship with the customer is so

3963
02:46:53,520 --> 02:47:00,279
different and Baristas know the names of

3964
02:46:57,319 --> 02:47:04,479
their customers they know their dog's

3965
02:47:00,279 --> 02:47:07,160
name we have a drive-thru and I saw a

3966
02:47:04,479 --> 02:47:09,560
video where the Barista knows the name

3967
02:47:07,160 --> 02:47:12,520
of the dog and knows the it just the

3968
02:47:09,560 --> 02:47:15,960
whole thing is it's like a magical dance

3969
02:47:12,520 --> 02:47:19,279
that happens when the cars pull in and

3970
02:47:15,960 --> 02:47:21,000
all of a sudden it's not a transaction

3971
02:47:19,279 --> 02:47:22,960
one of the beauties that we've been we

3972
02:47:21,000 --> 02:47:25,200
have been able to do is Elevate the

3973
02:47:22,960 --> 02:47:29,319
experience of the drive-thru not all the

3974
02:47:25,200 --> 02:47:33,600
time so I think your question is steeped

3975
02:47:29,319 --> 02:47:36,640
in one is a commoditized environment and

3976
02:47:33,600 --> 02:47:41,240
the other clearly is not and the

3977
02:47:36,640 --> 02:47:44,880
challenge for Starbucks is continuing to

3978
02:47:41,240 --> 02:47:49,399
innovate for the Barista and when you in

3979
02:47:44,880 --> 02:47:52,520
this category to extend that point

3980
02:47:49,399 --> 02:47:55,880
you start from a place of this a good

3981
02:47:52,520 --> 02:47:57,760
job and you can sort of improve the

3982
02:47:55,880 --> 02:47:58,800
experience for that employee so they can

3983
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:00,640
improve the experience for your

3984
02:47:58,800 --> 02:48:02,359
customers whereas in other things that

3985
02:48:00,640 --> 02:48:04,880
are commoditized they start from a

3986
02:48:02,359 --> 02:48:06,760
position of I have to do this job and

3987
02:48:04,880 --> 02:48:09,160
it's a really tough uphill battle to

3988
02:48:06,760 --> 02:48:11,479
invest in your people whereas Starbucks

3989
02:48:09,160 --> 02:48:13,560
kind of has a Tailwind but it is a hard

3990
02:48:11,479 --> 02:48:16,880
job certainly and we have to

3991
02:48:13,560 --> 02:48:20,160
honor the people who are doing it more

3992
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:22,960
so today than ever before yep another

3993
02:48:20,160 --> 02:48:25,760
one that I have is it's funny it flies

3994
02:48:22,960 --> 02:48:27,479
in the face of some of the um pitfalls

3995
02:48:25,760 --> 02:48:30,600
of ubiquity that we were discussing

3996
02:48:27,479 --> 02:48:32,880
before the fact that it is everywhere uh

3997
02:48:30,600 --> 02:48:35,120
almost cheapens the experience to me

3998
02:48:32,880 --> 02:48:37,319
Starbucks's ubiquity is a massive

3999
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:38,960
feature the fact that I can go anywhere

4000
02:48:37,319 --> 02:48:41,080
in the world and get basically my same

4001
02:48:38,960 --> 02:48:42,600
order or certainly anywhere in America

4002
02:48:41,080 --> 02:48:44,200
and get my same order I can even do it

4003
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:46,720
from the mobile app in a way that I'm

4004
02:48:44,200 --> 02:48:48,960
very familiar with ordering uh it's

4005
02:48:46,720 --> 02:48:50,920
reliable it's predictable like it's the

4006
02:48:48,960 --> 02:48:53,479
same reason I bank with Chase and I buy

4007
02:48:50,920 --> 02:48:55,880
Apple products it's it's this thing that

4008
02:48:53,479 --> 02:49:00,319
I just know works everywhere and I never

4009
02:48:55,880 --> 02:49:02,240
have to you know take any risk on and

4010
02:49:00,319 --> 02:49:04,880
Starbucks didn't have that when it was

4011
02:49:02,240 --> 02:49:07,920
starting but it really feels like it's

4012
02:49:04,880 --> 02:49:10,279
reached this scale that no one else can

4013
02:49:07,920 --> 02:49:12,760
really compete with the level of

4014
02:49:10,279 --> 02:49:15,399
ubiquity so

4015
02:49:12,760 --> 02:49:18,760
ubiquity earlier on in our conversation

4016
02:49:15,399 --> 02:49:21,800
I said ubiquity is an enemy of Starbucks

4017
02:49:18,760 --> 02:49:24,479
and it's an enemy because we can't be

4018
02:49:21,800 --> 02:49:28,080
defined by our ubiquity we have to be

4019
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:30,160
defined by the one store you come into

4020
02:49:28,080 --> 02:49:32,800
not based on the thousands but that

4021
02:49:30,160 --> 02:49:37,640
experience you have in the store yeah so

4022
02:49:32,800 --> 02:49:38,760
if the ubiquity is driving trust and

4023
02:49:37,640 --> 02:49:41,680
driving

4024
02:49:38,760 --> 02:49:44,800
convenience we have to ensure the fact

4025
02:49:41,680 --> 02:49:48,000
that we are providing that Intimacy in

4026
02:49:44,800 --> 02:49:50,760
the store and not allowing ubiquity to

4027
02:49:48,000 --> 02:49:53,560
commoditize the experience that that is

4028
02:49:50,760 --> 02:49:54,560
the framework of the daily challenge of

4029
02:49:53,560 --> 02:49:56,960
the

4030
02:49:54,560 --> 02:49:58,920
company frustratingly for those of us

4031
02:49:56,960 --> 02:50:01,000
who are trying to analytically put this

4032
02:49:58,920 --> 02:50:03,600
puzzle together the humanity is actually

4033
02:50:01,000 --> 02:50:06,640
the answer yeah scaling humanity is

4034
02:50:03,600 --> 02:50:08,160
actually the you know along with got

4035
02:50:06,640 --> 02:50:10,279
this long list here this obsessive

4036
02:50:08,160 --> 02:50:11,960
quality of product the fact that product

4037
02:50:10,279 --> 02:50:13,319
isn't just product but experience is the

4038
02:50:11,960 --> 02:50:15,479
product as it's everything you

4039
02:50:13,319 --> 02:50:17,960
experience around consuming the beverage

4040
02:50:15,479 --> 02:50:19,160
itself it's uh a bunch of the things

4041
02:50:17,960 --> 02:50:20,640
we've already talked about you invest in

4042
02:50:19,160 --> 02:50:21,840
your employees they take care of the

4043
02:50:20,640 --> 02:50:23,479
customers who takes care of the

4044
02:50:21,840 --> 02:50:27,319
shareholders but the shareholders are

4045
02:50:23,479 --> 02:50:28,560
last it's the fact that um oh yeah we

4046
02:50:27,319 --> 02:50:31,160
talked about the store cash flow

4047
02:50:28,560 --> 02:50:32,880
dynamics that you can scale in a really

4048
02:50:31,160 --> 02:50:35,279
cash efficient way when you know you're

4049
02:50:32,880 --> 02:50:37,720
paying the stores back in in less than

4050
02:50:35,279 --> 02:50:39,120
two years every time every store is a

4051
02:50:37,720 --> 02:50:41,560
billboard so you're intentionally

4052
02:50:39,120 --> 02:50:43,560
picking real estate in these places

4053
02:50:41,560 --> 02:50:45,239
where you're building familiarity with

4054
02:50:43,560 --> 02:50:47,720
people they're walking by over and over

4055
02:50:45,239 --> 02:50:49,760
and over you're extending the brand by

4056
02:50:47,720 --> 02:50:51,560
doing United Airlines by going to

4057
02:50:49,760 --> 02:50:53,040
grocery stores everything is a billboard

4058
02:50:51,560 --> 02:50:54,760
everything is a billboard yeah that's

4059
02:50:53,040 --> 02:50:57,399
the like why pay for customer

4060
02:50:54,760 --> 02:51:01,439
acquisition when you can you know

4061
02:50:57,399 --> 02:51:04,239
product in people's hands yeah um the

4062
02:51:01,439 --> 02:51:05,800
third place you know very novel idea at

4063
02:51:04,239 --> 02:51:07,319
first turned out that was something

4064
02:51:05,800 --> 02:51:09,680
basically the entire country and then

4065
02:51:07,319 --> 02:51:12,560
the the world wanted to participate in

4066
02:51:09,680 --> 02:51:13,920
not obvious at first and it's so easy to

4067
02:51:12,560 --> 02:51:16,000
think about these things that now we

4068
02:51:13,920 --> 02:51:19,479
take completely for granted like

4069
02:51:16,000 --> 02:51:22,000
Starbucks is in infrastructure in our

4070
02:51:19,479 --> 02:51:24,600
society it is assumed like when I go to

4071
02:51:22,000 --> 02:51:26,840
an airport or a city and there's not an

4072
02:51:24,600 --> 02:51:29,520
easy way to get to a store I'm like what

4073
02:51:26,840 --> 02:51:33,319
what is this place what Backwoods Place

4074
02:51:29,520 --> 02:51:35,840
am I in like it's it's it's expected and

4075
02:51:33,319 --> 02:51:37,680
when you live with something you know

4076
02:51:35,840 --> 02:51:41,359
most of your life you forget that it was

4077
02:51:37,680 --> 02:51:42,720
once a crazy idea I think that's the

4078
02:51:41,359 --> 02:51:44,680
yeah I think I think the other piece

4079
02:51:42,720 --> 02:51:46,160
that you didn't just list off there uh

4080
02:51:44,680 --> 02:51:48,560
that we've covered in depth is is you

4081
02:51:46,160 --> 02:51:50,640
know the cost go like investment in your

4082
02:51:48,560 --> 02:51:54,560
employees and the people and the

4083
02:51:50,640 --> 02:51:57,399
reduction of turnover and you know in in

4084
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:59,720
Costco's case I think it's probably much

4085
02:51:57,399 --> 02:52:02,439
more so the reduction of turnover in

4086
02:51:59,720 --> 02:52:05,239
Starbucks's case it really is like

4087
02:52:02,439 --> 02:52:07,920
that's a a key the key element to

4088
02:52:05,239 --> 02:52:11,760
building the humanity right like I don't

4089
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:13,560
know the employees at my Costco store no

4090
02:52:11,760 --> 02:52:15,760
what's the stat that you have on um I've

4091
02:52:13,560 --> 02:52:17,399
heard you say it a number of times on um

4092
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:19,080
employee tenure at Starbucks versus

4093
02:52:17,399 --> 02:52:21,359
others in the category

4094
02:52:19,080 --> 02:52:23,439
it's a 2X is what I believe that

4095
02:52:21,359 --> 02:52:26,560
employee tenure is 2x longer or turnover

4096
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:29,359
is half of what it is industrywide yes

4097
02:52:26,560 --> 02:52:31,160
it makes a huge difference and you've

4098
02:52:29,359 --> 02:52:33,040
talked about bean stock you've talked

4099
02:52:31,160 --> 02:52:35,279
about Comprehensive Health

4100
02:52:33,040 --> 02:52:37,279
Insurance when I think about the most

4101
02:52:35,279 --> 02:52:41,520
important thing we probably have done in

4102
02:52:37,279 --> 02:52:43,760
the last 20 years it's been the unique

4103
02:52:41,520 --> 02:52:45,520
relationship that we established with

4104
02:52:43,760 --> 02:52:48,880
Arizona State University and its

4105
02:52:45,520 --> 02:52:51,359
President Michael Crow could we create

4106
02:52:48,880 --> 02:52:54,319
free college tuition a 4-year free

4107
02:52:51,359 --> 02:52:56,800
college tuition through AR Ona state for

4108
02:52:54,319 --> 02:53:00,160
every single partner at Starbucks and we

4109
02:52:56,800 --> 02:53:03,359
did it and thousands of Starbucks

4110
02:53:00,160 --> 02:53:06,680
partners are engaged and going to school

4111
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:09,479
and thousands have graduated the college

4112
02:53:06,680 --> 02:53:11,560
achievement plan demonstrates going back

4113
02:53:09,479 --> 02:53:14,200
to the early years of the speeches I was

4114
02:53:11,560 --> 02:53:16,479
giving about what is the responsibility

4115
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:18,640
for a for-profit company in the world

4116
02:53:16,479 --> 02:53:19,520
we're living in and it's not just to

4117
02:53:18,640 --> 02:53:22,640
make

4118
02:53:19,520 --> 02:53:24,600
money here's one that we haven't talked

4119
02:53:22,640 --> 02:53:27,160
as much

4120
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:30,319
about you were part of this secular

4121
02:53:27,160 --> 02:53:32,279
trend of gourmet coffee and I'm curious

4122
02:53:30,319 --> 02:53:34,760
if you

4123
02:53:32,279 --> 02:53:37,760
view that to be a true statement or if

4124
02:53:34,760 --> 02:53:40,239
you're saying no we created this entire

4125
02:53:37,760 --> 02:53:43,920
wave it wasn't going to happen it wasn't

4126
02:53:40,239 --> 02:53:45,880
just like I don't want to sound arrogant

4127
02:53:43,920 --> 02:53:48,520
at all but I think it's so clear that

4128
02:53:45,880 --> 02:53:49,399
Starbucks created an industry that did

4129
02:53:48,520 --> 02:53:51,000
not

4130
02:53:49,399 --> 02:53:55,600
exist

4131
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:58,760
and as a result tens of thousands of

4132
02:53:55,600 --> 02:54:00,439
stores have followed in our wake and we

4133
02:53:58,760 --> 02:54:01,239
created an employment industry that did

4134
02:54:00,439 --> 02:54:04,399
not

4135
02:54:01,239 --> 02:54:07,120
exist not to mention that 5 million this

4136
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:08,319
five million alone right yeah that's a

4137
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:10,319
lot of people who have gone on to do

4138
02:54:08,319 --> 02:54:12,680
other things after and I think one thing

4139
02:54:10,319 --> 02:54:16,200
that's always been missed is that

4140
02:54:12,680 --> 02:54:19,960
Starbucks has always been a great first

4141
02:54:16,200 --> 02:54:21,880
job so in your mind then let's say

4142
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:23,399
there's a parallel universe where Howard

4143
02:54:21,880 --> 02:54:25,800
Schultz doesn't

4144
02:54:23,399 --> 02:54:28,239
exist the year is

4145
02:54:25,800 --> 02:54:29,960
1995 is there

4146
02:54:28,239 --> 02:54:32,680
a

4147
02:54:29,960 --> 02:54:34,880
nationwide chain not called Starbucks

4148
02:54:32,680 --> 02:54:36,640
with Gourmet Coffee taking off in the

4149
02:54:34,880 --> 02:54:37,920
United States because the conditions

4150
02:54:36,640 --> 02:54:40,880
were perfect for

4151
02:54:37,920 --> 02:54:43,080
it I would assume that there would have

4152
02:54:40,880 --> 02:54:46,080
been a national

4153
02:54:43,080 --> 02:54:49,600
franchised business that would have

4154
02:54:46,080 --> 02:54:52,160
occupied the coffee space M but would

4155
02:54:49,600 --> 02:54:55,560
have been more commoditized a Dunkin

4156
02:54:52,160 --> 02:54:56,640
Donuts for instance yeah nothing I don't

4157
02:54:55,560 --> 02:54:59,840
think

4158
02:54:56,640 --> 02:55:02,279
anything would have been executed like

4159
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:04,520
Starbucks but I think some someone would

4160
02:55:02,279 --> 02:55:06,720
have showed up right the opportunity was

4161
02:55:04,520 --> 02:55:08,640
just right too much white space the the

4162
02:55:06,720 --> 02:55:11,000
there was clearly demand there we were

4163
02:55:08,640 --> 02:55:12,920
coming off this horrible you know

4164
02:55:11,000 --> 02:55:15,840
folders in Maxwell House era and there

4165
02:55:12,920 --> 02:55:17,920
was this growing demand but that doesn't

4166
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:20,040
mean that a company like Starbucks would

4167
02:55:17,920 --> 02:55:21,680
have been created it means just in some

4168
02:55:20,040 --> 02:55:23,960
way that consumer demand would have been

4169
02:55:21,680 --> 02:55:27,200
satisfied well you have to remember our

4170
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:29,279
intent was not to build a global

4171
02:55:27,200 --> 02:55:31,399
business you know the first business

4172
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:33,479
plan and I've I've said this many times

4173
02:55:31,399 --> 02:55:36,120
when I was raising money was a 100

4174
02:55:33,479 --> 02:55:38,080
stores and I I wasn't raising the money

4175
02:55:36,120 --> 02:55:39,720
and I didn't couldn't afford to reprint

4176
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:41,479
the whole document whatever that was at

4177
02:55:39,720 --> 02:55:44,120
the time and I Whited it out no one's

4178
02:55:41,479 --> 02:55:45,439
even to know what that means I whiteed

4179
02:55:44,120 --> 02:55:47,600
out

4180
02:55:45,439 --> 02:55:50,279
75 when was the last time you used a

4181
02:55:47,600 --> 02:55:52,439
white out yeah it's been a while it's

4182
02:55:50,279 --> 02:55:54,840
been wait really so you yeah why did it

4183
02:55:52,439 --> 02:55:56,880
out 75 cuz I couldn't did it feel too

4184
02:55:54,840 --> 02:55:59,520
ambitious yeah people didn't believe I

4185
02:55:56,880 --> 02:56:03,479
think you're crazy but we never we we

4186
02:55:59,520 --> 02:56:05,000
you know Japan was the turning point of

4187
02:56:03,479 --> 02:56:07,760
thinking we could build an international

4188
02:56:05,000 --> 02:56:10,279
business but we we none of us had any

4189
02:56:07,760 --> 02:56:11,479
International experience no one in the

4190
02:56:10,279 --> 02:56:15,000
whole entire

4191
02:56:11,479 --> 02:56:18,319
company I mean in anyways you could say

4192
02:56:15,000 --> 02:56:22,359
this shouldn't have happened yeah okay

4193
02:56:18,319 --> 02:56:24,680
so this brings us to the absolute magic

4194
02:56:22,359 --> 02:56:28,479
of founder-led businesses mhm I mean

4195
02:56:24,680 --> 02:56:31,760
when you have a Founder at the helm you

4196
02:56:28,479 --> 02:56:34,840
get all this leeway from shareholders

4197
02:56:31,760 --> 02:56:36,520
from employees you can take crazy risks

4198
02:56:34,840 --> 02:56:39,319
and people know it's cuz you're you but

4199
02:56:36,520 --> 02:56:42,960
for you it wouldn't exist at all so run

4200
02:56:39,319 --> 02:56:44,880
with it what are the biggest innovations

4201
02:56:42,960 --> 02:56:46,279
that have happened at Starbucks not

4202
02:56:44,880 --> 02:56:49,479
under Howard

4203
02:56:46,279 --> 02:56:52,279
Schultz what a question

4204
02:56:49,479 --> 02:56:53,800
I'm pausing not because there hasn't

4205
02:56:52,279 --> 02:56:56,359
been

4206
02:56:53,800 --> 02:56:58,680
any uh because I'm sure there has

4207
02:56:56,359 --> 02:57:00,160
been but I'm hard pressed to kind of

4208
02:56:58,680 --> 02:57:02,880
think about what it

4209
02:57:00,160 --> 02:57:04,720
was I don't think you were uh running

4210
02:57:02,880 --> 02:57:07,640
the show when the pumpkin spice latte

4211
02:57:04,720 --> 02:57:11,399
came out yes I was you were I thought I

4212
02:57:07,640 --> 02:57:15,439
had one yeah yes I was I didn't like it

4213
02:57:11,399 --> 02:57:18,160
oh yeah it does feel like you were um

4214
02:57:15,439 --> 02:57:19,479
obsessed with the purity of the Italian

4215
02:57:18,160 --> 02:57:22,359
coffee bar for a long time and then at

4216
02:57:19,479 --> 02:57:24,720
some point you were like actually what

4217
02:57:22,359 --> 02:57:26,640
I'm obsessed with is serving customers

4218
02:57:24,720 --> 02:57:29,319
in whatever they want from us well the

4219
02:57:26,640 --> 02:57:32,359
ilali store only played Italian opera

4220
02:57:29,319 --> 02:57:34,200
and had no had no chairs I mean would

4221
02:57:32,359 --> 02:57:35,840
have scaled as well I'm recalling my

4222
02:57:34,200 --> 02:57:37,439
time from Rome two years ago that's

4223
02:57:35,840 --> 02:57:39,439
literally I'm walking around Rome and

4224
02:57:37,439 --> 02:57:41,040
that's everywhere yeah it's completely

4225
02:57:39,439 --> 02:57:43,239
different then no I think I had to see

4226
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:45,200
the light I had to understand we were

4227
02:57:43,239 --> 02:57:48,200
not in business to please me please the

4228
02:57:45,200 --> 02:57:50,720
customers I mean what is it 70% of

4229
02:57:48,200 --> 02:57:53,000
drinks are now ice Beverages and it was

4230
02:57:50,720 --> 02:57:54,399
when you started 0% didn't have a cold

4231
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:55,479
beverage for the first decade it was

4232
02:57:54,399 --> 02:58:00,040
Zero

4233
02:57:55,479 --> 02:58:02,319
yeah so to me there's this threat of um

4234
02:58:00,040 --> 02:58:04,160
at some point shaking off your own

4235
02:58:02,319 --> 02:58:07,000
opinions and saying we're going to do

4236
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:08,560
what the customer wants us to do to a

4237
02:58:07,000 --> 02:58:11,160
degree

4238
02:58:08,560 --> 02:58:13,520
yeah but I was clearly leading there was

4239
02:58:11,160 --> 02:58:15,439
a leading question around Innovations

4240
02:58:13,520 --> 02:58:17,120
not under yeah so what's the point

4241
02:58:15,439 --> 02:58:19,279
what's the what's

4242
02:58:17,120 --> 02:58:21,200
your it's not it's not that there hasn't

4243
02:58:19,279 --> 02:58:25,600
been Innovation I

4244
02:58:21,200 --> 02:58:29,399
think uh there's a burden that the

4245
02:58:25,600 --> 02:58:33,840
organization has and a Reliance on the

4246
02:58:29,399 --> 02:58:36,439
founder that over time can become

4247
02:58:33,840 --> 02:58:40,080
unhealthy and not that I didn't want

4248
02:58:36,439 --> 02:58:41,479
succession I just I wasn't wasn't really

4249
02:58:40,080 --> 02:58:46,279
on my

4250
02:58:41,479 --> 02:58:49,920
mind and uh the the marketing and the

4251
02:58:46,279 --> 02:58:53,200
merchant mentality of Starbucks BS was

4252
02:58:49,920 --> 02:58:56,960
always with me and probably did not

4253
02:58:53,200 --> 02:58:59,080
allow others who were well intended and

4254
02:58:56,960 --> 02:59:01,760
could have done good things were

4255
02:58:59,080 --> 02:59:05,040
following and leaning on me which is not

4256
02:59:01,760 --> 02:59:07,560
the healthiest thing over the longevity

4257
02:59:05,040 --> 02:59:08,800
of the company and I think that has

4258
02:59:07,560 --> 02:59:11,040
covered up

4259
02:59:08,800 --> 02:59:13,800
mistakes that that's covered up things

4260
02:59:11,040 --> 02:59:17,040
and then was revealed when I

4261
02:59:13,800 --> 02:59:18,720
left I mean it's the very things that

4262
02:59:17,040 --> 02:59:22,000
make the business success uccessful the

4263
02:59:18,720 --> 02:59:24,120
founder bets that then at some point in

4264
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:26,279
the company's second act kind of hold it

4265
02:59:24,120 --> 02:59:29,520
back you have all this muscle memory as

4266
02:59:26,279 --> 02:59:32,040
a company of relying on Founder Maverick

4267
02:59:29,520 --> 02:59:34,160
acts at some point you need to figure

4268
02:59:32,040 --> 02:59:38,399
out how as a company to

4269
02:59:34,160 --> 02:59:41,600
not well the the other thing about that

4270
02:59:38,399 --> 02:59:44,680
is most founder-led

4271
02:59:41,600 --> 02:59:47,600
companies are entrepreneurially

4272
02:59:44,680 --> 02:59:50,279
driven they're they're not it's not that

4273
02:59:47,600 --> 02:59:52,760
they're not following the rules they're

4274
02:59:50,279 --> 02:59:55,399
making the rules especially if you're

4275
02:59:52,760 --> 02:59:58,880
creating an industry that did not exist

4276
02:59:55,399 --> 03:00:02,920
founder leaves I'm not talking about me

4277
02:59:58,880 --> 03:00:05,680
historically and companies lose not only

4278
03:00:02,920 --> 03:00:10,239
the extent of the entrepreneurial

4279
03:00:05,680 --> 03:00:13,120
DNA but they lose the ability to be on

4280
03:00:10,239 --> 03:00:15,800
offense and the worst thing that a

4281
03:00:13,120 --> 03:00:18,359
company can do like a sports team is

4282
03:00:15,800 --> 03:00:19,680
start playing defense because you're

4283
03:00:18,359 --> 03:00:22,319
afraid to

4284
03:00:19,680 --> 03:00:25,600
fail that is a

4285
03:00:22,319 --> 03:00:27,840
disease not unlike another disease which

4286
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:28,720
has happened at Starbucks which is ubis

4287
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:30,720
the

4288
03:00:28,720 --> 03:00:33,720
worst thing that could happen to a

4289
03:00:30,720 --> 03:00:35,479
company is believing that you are

4290
03:00:33,720 --> 03:00:38,160
incapable of doing anything but

4291
03:00:35,479 --> 03:00:39,880
succeeding and you deserve the success

4292
03:00:38,160 --> 03:00:44,439
but if you start playing defense and

4293
03:00:39,880 --> 03:00:48,239
don't have the the offensive

4294
03:00:44,439 --> 03:00:51,080
mind it's it's not going to go well and

4295
03:00:48,239 --> 03:00:53,680
I think over time that has happened at

4296
03:00:51,080 --> 03:00:56,399
sterox you've transitioned from being

4297
03:00:53,680 --> 03:00:59,080
the CEO to someone else three different

4298
03:00:56,399 --> 03:01:00,560
times if you could go back let's even

4299
03:00:59,080 --> 03:01:04,399
just say the first time if you could go

4300
03:01:00,560 --> 03:01:08,239
back years 1999 or 1997 so you can start

4301
03:01:04,399 --> 03:01:10,160
working on some Talent Development um

4302
03:01:08,239 --> 03:01:11,160
what would you do differently to make

4303
03:01:10,160 --> 03:01:13,479
sure that

4304
03:01:11,160 --> 03:01:14,720
succession I would have believed Orin

4305
03:01:13,479 --> 03:01:16,920
when he said I only want to do this for

4306
03:01:14,720 --> 03:01:18,840
a couple years and I convinced myself I

4307
03:01:16,920 --> 03:01:21,000
could just get Orin to do this 5 years

4308
03:01:18,840 --> 03:01:23,160
maybe 10 years and so when he kept

4309
03:01:21,000 --> 03:01:25,600
saying you know I I want I don't want to

4310
03:01:23,160 --> 03:01:27,200
do this anymore I just so I was stuck

4311
03:01:25,600 --> 03:01:29,800
because I was not

4312
03:01:27,200 --> 03:01:31,479
prepared to look around the room and say

4313
03:01:29,800 --> 03:01:35,040
God I think he could do it and if I

4314
03:01:31,479 --> 03:01:38,399
would have spent maybe a year or two and

4315
03:01:35,040 --> 03:01:39,720
but I didn't I I was very I I believed

4316
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:43,239
that I could convince norin to stay

4317
03:01:39,720 --> 03:01:46,080
longer and so I think and also Jim

4318
03:01:43,239 --> 03:01:49,080
Donald's a great guy but I I think the

4319
03:01:46,080 --> 03:01:51,319
immersion of an outside at that time

4320
03:01:49,080 --> 03:01:54,600
given we were moving into a

4321
03:01:51,319 --> 03:01:58,479
crisis not a Starbucks crisis but the

4322
03:01:54,600 --> 03:02:02,160
financial financial crisis very

4323
03:01:58,479 --> 03:02:04,160
difficult so it's on me I think when I

4324
03:02:02,160 --> 03:02:07,000
look back and I just did not do a very

4325
03:02:04,160 --> 03:02:10,239
good job of recognizing the internal

4326
03:02:07,000 --> 03:02:12,600
talent and cultivating it but I want to

4327
03:02:10,239 --> 03:02:15,479
I want to say one more thing about

4328
03:02:12,600 --> 03:02:19,200
Starbucks and it's the complexity of it

4329
03:02:15,479 --> 03:02:21,800
we're in multiple businesses so we're in

4330
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:24,640
the agricultural business we are buying

4331
03:02:21,800 --> 03:02:27,640
coffee from 30 producing countries

4332
03:02:24,640 --> 03:02:30,399
around the world we are subject to

4333
03:02:27,640 --> 03:02:32,000
weather and the agricultural issues some

4334
03:02:30,399 --> 03:02:35,359
of which are many of which are not in

4335
03:02:32,000 --> 03:02:39,720
our control political all kinds of

4336
03:02:35,359 --> 03:02:42,160
stuff second we are

4337
03:02:39,720 --> 03:02:45,840
manufacturing a a

4338
03:02:42,160 --> 03:02:47,399
a commodity that is very very

4339
03:02:45,840 --> 03:02:49,600
challenging because it's coming from 30

4340
03:02:47,399 --> 03:02:52,920
producing countries and each coffee each

4341
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:55,239
coffee from every country has its own

4342
03:02:52,920 --> 03:02:57,880
proprietary taste

4343
03:02:55,239 --> 03:03:00,080
profile that has to be roasted

4344
03:02:57,880 --> 03:03:04,560
differently and when you're blending it

4345
03:03:00,080 --> 03:03:06,560
like a winery it it's art and so we're

4346
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:08,720
we're an agricultural

4347
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:10,920
buyer we are a

4348
03:03:08,720 --> 03:03:13,439
manufacturer we are a

4349
03:03:10,920 --> 03:03:16,439
retailer we are a

4350
03:03:13,439 --> 03:03:20,120
wholesaler we are managing JV

4351
03:03:16,439 --> 03:03:23,399
relationships in 80 countries we have

4352
03:03:20,120 --> 03:03:26,840
JVS with two Behemoth companies Nestle

4353
03:03:23,399 --> 03:03:30,279
and pepsicola and above all else we are

4354
03:03:26,840 --> 03:03:33,200
in the people business managing the

4355
03:03:30,279 --> 03:03:35,479
behavior the motivation and the

4356
03:03:33,200 --> 03:03:37,439
opportunity creation for five almost

4357
03:03:35,479 --> 03:03:40,600
500,000

4358
03:03:37,439 --> 03:03:42,680
people and we're a public company in

4359
03:03:40,600 --> 03:03:45,479
which the expectations based on our

4360
03:03:42,680 --> 03:03:47,960
success are have been higher than

4361
03:03:45,479 --> 03:03:51,520
most not to mention your quasi fin

4362
03:03:47,960 --> 03:03:55,239
institution too yeah and we've got it

4363
03:03:51,520 --> 03:03:58,319
yeah all of that and uh and lastly I

4364
03:03:55,239 --> 03:04:02,479
think the the personal

4365
03:03:58,319 --> 03:04:05,800
responsibility of a Founder in my case

4366
03:04:02,479 --> 03:04:06,640
who loves this company as much as I love

4367
03:04:05,800 --> 03:04:09,600
my

4368
03:04:06,640 --> 03:04:12,319
family and so it's it's it's a

4369
03:04:09,600 --> 03:04:15,760
challenging fragile thing on a very

4370
03:04:12,319 --> 03:04:18,160
personal level and you can't escape

4371
03:04:15,760 --> 03:04:19,680
it you you made your point you want to

4372
03:04:18,160 --> 03:04:22,640
go somewhere and get I mean you can't

4373
03:04:19,680 --> 03:04:24,399
escape it so it's always around you I'm

4374
03:04:22,640 --> 03:04:26,600
so glad you're bringing this up it

4375
03:04:24,399 --> 03:04:29,200
really resonates to us hearing you say

4376
03:04:26,600 --> 03:04:32,200
that like it's the way we feel about

4377
03:04:29,200 --> 03:04:33,760
acquired in our show and like to imagine

4378
03:04:32,200 --> 03:04:36,040
like that's easy for us we have no

4379
03:04:33,760 --> 03:04:38,600
stakeholders we never would expect that

4380
03:04:36,040 --> 03:04:41,520
this would scale to 500,000 people if it

4381
03:04:38,600 --> 03:04:44,200
did I can't even imagine the complexity

4382
03:04:41,520 --> 03:04:46,960
of that but you also have now that

4383
03:04:44,200 --> 03:04:48,840
you've achieved this level of success

4384
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:51,520
you you you have an expectation that

4385
03:04:48,840 --> 03:04:53,160
you've got to keep not Reinventing but

4386
03:04:51,520 --> 03:04:56,319
you've got to make sure that you're as

4387
03:04:53,160 --> 03:04:59,479
good as you've been no better you got to

4388
03:04:56,319 --> 03:05:03,279
be better again and your success is not

4389
03:04:59,479 --> 03:05:06,200
an entitlement like Starbucks just isn't

4390
03:05:03,279 --> 03:05:08,080
and and and when you have success it

4391
03:05:06,200 --> 03:05:09,720
gets harder because the bar keeps

4392
03:05:08,080 --> 03:05:11,479
getting higher yeah that's just human

4393
03:05:09,720 --> 03:05:13,680
expectations I going into this I was

4394
03:05:11,479 --> 03:05:15,560
thinking um I had some funny thing occur

4395
03:05:13,680 --> 03:05:16,680
to me which was at some point why does

4396
03:05:15,560 --> 03:05:18,680
Starbucks need to grow anymore it's

4397
03:05:16,680 --> 03:05:20,840
already everywhere and of course like

4398
03:05:18,680 --> 03:05:23,040
it's a public company so it it it

4399
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:24,960
literally has just has to keep growing

4400
03:05:23,040 --> 03:05:26,880
but it's just human expectation that

4401
03:05:24,960 --> 03:05:29,760
things keep getting better than they

4402
03:05:26,880 --> 03:05:30,960
were last year they should should people

4403
03:05:29,760 --> 03:05:33,040
should just figure it out and make it

4404
03:05:30,960 --> 03:05:35,800
better we all think that about every

4405
03:05:33,040 --> 03:05:38,239
product and experience that we have

4406
03:05:35,800 --> 03:05:40,560
indeed well listeners we were thinking

4407
03:05:38,239 --> 03:05:42,880
about how to land this episode and you

4408
03:05:40,560 --> 03:05:44,800
know in our normal episodes we land the

4409
03:05:42,880 --> 03:05:47,080
plane in some way or come up with the

4410
03:05:44,800 --> 03:05:48,640
one thing you really you can't leave the

4411
03:05:47,080 --> 03:05:50,439
episode with without thinking about and

4412
03:05:48,640 --> 03:05:52,600
I feel like we covered a lot of those in

4413
03:05:50,439 --> 03:05:54,920
Playbook and so rather than drilling

4414
03:05:52,600 --> 03:05:56,880
into that again we were talking with

4415
03:05:54,920 --> 03:05:59,680
Howard and he threw out this idea I I

4416
03:05:56,880 --> 03:06:01,399
really do have one more thing to say

4417
03:05:59,680 --> 03:06:04,560
yeah given this moment that Starbucks is

4418
03:06:01,399 --> 03:06:06,920
in right now here in summer of 20124

4419
03:06:04,560 --> 03:06:09,960
this felt like the right way to address

4420
03:06:06,920 --> 03:06:14,640
that back to the interview well Howard

4421
03:06:09,960 --> 03:06:16,080
we're we're at the end here and uh I

4422
03:06:14,640 --> 03:06:18,040
think listeners may be wondering okay

4423
03:06:16,080 --> 03:06:20,080
but what about Starbucks today yeah and

4424
03:06:18,040 --> 03:06:22,520
the last few years have seen you know

4425
03:06:20,080 --> 03:06:24,600
you come back as an CEO for a year

4426
03:06:22,520 --> 03:06:28,399
transition to a new CEO it's been about

4427
03:06:24,600 --> 03:06:30,239
a year after that um and it's been a a

4428
03:06:28,399 --> 03:06:32,960
rough couple years I mean part of it is

4429
03:06:30,239 --> 03:06:34,279
coming out of the pandemic but um I

4430
03:06:32,960 --> 03:06:36,200
think anybody who tuned in the last

4431
03:06:34,279 --> 03:06:38,239
earnings call is wondering what's up

4432
03:06:36,200 --> 03:06:39,279
with the future of this company right um

4433
03:06:38,239 --> 03:06:41,399
can you give us a little bit of

4434
03:06:39,279 --> 03:06:42,840
narration on what brought you back the

4435
03:06:41,399 --> 03:06:47,040
things you did and where the company is

4436
03:06:42,840 --> 03:06:49,760
today yeah let me try and go back to

4437
03:06:47,040 --> 03:06:52,040
when I returned as an interim CEO in

4438
03:06:49,760 --> 03:06:54,120
April of

4439
03:06:52,040 --> 03:06:58,120
22

4440
03:06:54,120 --> 03:07:01,200
um I was asked by the board to come back

4441
03:06:58,120 --> 03:07:03,200
to the company and I I said no I I my my

4442
03:07:01,200 --> 03:07:05,000
life has changed I have I have no desire

4443
03:07:03,200 --> 03:07:08,439
to come back I have no intent to come

4444
03:07:05,000 --> 03:07:10,800
back but it was clear to me as the weeks

4445
03:07:08,439 --> 03:07:15,359
were going on that the company was

4446
03:07:10,800 --> 03:07:17,840
heading into a exential crisis and if

4447
03:07:15,359 --> 03:07:19,239
your listeners take anything away from

4448
03:07:17,840 --> 03:07:22,800
what we've talked about is my love of

4449
03:07:19,239 --> 03:07:26,640
the company is so significant that I I

4450
03:07:22,800 --> 03:07:28,760
changed my life and uh I came back to

4451
03:07:26,640 --> 03:07:31,920
the company now when I came

4452
03:07:28,760 --> 03:07:35,200
back and I want to be fair I don't want

4453
03:07:31,920 --> 03:07:37,760
to criticize anyone but when I came back

4454
03:07:35,200 --> 03:07:40,600
I saw things that really surprised me

4455
03:07:37,760 --> 03:07:43,279
about the lack of investment over a four

4456
03:07:40,600 --> 03:07:46,560
to five year period and also I didn't

4457
03:07:43,279 --> 03:07:49,680
like the way the stock BuyBacks were

4458
03:07:46,560 --> 03:07:51,840
were being used used to

4459
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:54,359
basically uh increase

4460
03:07:51,840 --> 03:07:57,720
EPs and uh it's no way to run a company

4461
03:07:54,359 --> 03:08:00,279
so the First first day I came back and I

4462
03:07:57,720 --> 03:08:01,880
knew what the market would do is I I

4463
03:08:00,279 --> 03:08:04,279
announced that we were suspending the

4464
03:08:01,880 --> 03:08:06,640
stock BuyBacks and the stock went down I

4465
03:08:04,279 --> 03:08:08,520
expected it and I announced that we were

4466
03:08:06,640 --> 03:08:10,600
going to take basically the money we're

4467
03:08:08,520 --> 03:08:12,479
using to stock BuyBacks for the year and

4468
03:08:10,600 --> 03:08:15,560
I think was north of $2 billion and

4469
03:08:12,479 --> 03:08:17,880
invest back into the people of Starbucks

4470
03:08:15,560 --> 03:08:19,520
the partners which I did the most

4471
03:08:17,880 --> 03:08:22,239
important thing I did

4472
03:08:19,520 --> 03:08:23,600
though because I'm not a messiah but I

4473
03:08:22,239 --> 03:08:24,840
have an instinct about the company and I

4474
03:08:23,600 --> 03:08:26,160
know the inner workings of the company

4475
03:08:24,840 --> 03:08:30,800
better than anyone else I know the

4476
03:08:26,160 --> 03:08:32,600
people and so in a in a year's time

4477
03:08:30,800 --> 03:08:34,920
despite the underinvestment and the

4478
03:08:32,600 --> 03:08:37,120
challenges we we brought the company

4479
03:08:34,920 --> 03:08:38,960
back to a much healthier place

4480
03:08:37,120 --> 03:08:41,200
operationally and certainly the stock

4481
03:08:38,960 --> 03:08:43,960
price was significantly higher when I

4482
03:08:41,200 --> 03:08:45,479
left I think when I came back when I

4483
03:08:43,960 --> 03:08:46,920
when I started it was in the 70s when I

4484
03:08:45,479 --> 03:08:49,880
left it was you know but that's an

4485
03:08:46,920 --> 03:08:51,760
output that's investors voting on the

4486
03:08:49,880 --> 03:08:53,720
performance yeah yeah we don't have to

4487
03:08:51,760 --> 03:08:55,000
talk about stock price we don't want to

4488
03:08:53,720 --> 03:08:58,960
um

4489
03:08:55,000 --> 03:09:01,080
nevertheless um again

4490
03:08:58,960 --> 03:09:05,160
succession and

4491
03:09:01,080 --> 03:09:07,880
uh the board led a succession

4492
03:09:05,160 --> 03:09:11,479
process you have to remember I wasn't on

4493
03:09:07,880 --> 03:09:14,960
the board for f for long four or five

4494
03:09:11,479 --> 03:09:16,359
years and I resigned when I when I

4495
03:09:14,960 --> 03:09:18,720
decided

4496
03:09:16,359 --> 03:09:20,200
to leave the company after a year

4497
03:09:18,720 --> 03:09:22,600
despite the board asking me to stay

4498
03:09:20,200 --> 03:09:25,000
another year I just said I've I've done

4499
03:09:22,600 --> 03:09:26,399
my duty we have to find a new coo and so

4500
03:09:25,000 --> 03:09:28,439
they wanted you to be interim CEO for a

4501
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:30,600
second yeah they wanted it was up it was

4502
03:09:28,439 --> 03:09:31,960
up to me and I I just that we and so the

4503
03:09:30,600 --> 03:09:35,600
board led a

4504
03:09:31,960 --> 03:09:39,560
search uh there was a number of

4505
03:09:35,600 --> 03:09:44,040
candidates uh laxman was chosen I met

4506
03:09:39,560 --> 03:09:48,439
him I approved his hiring uh but the

4507
03:09:44,040 --> 03:09:50,239
search Community was driving the process

4508
03:09:48,439 --> 03:09:52,279
so now we're a year

4509
03:09:50,239 --> 03:09:54,680
later um and I think we probably let's

4510
03:09:52,279 --> 03:09:58,000
just fast forward it hasn't been a great

4511
03:09:54,680 --> 03:09:59,520
year for Starbucks in fairness to laxman

4512
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:02,439
there's a lot of external issues that

4513
03:09:59,520 --> 03:10:05,600
have contributed to the pressure like on

4514
03:10:02,439 --> 03:10:08,160
every company but the

4515
03:10:05,600 --> 03:10:11,720
company has not

4516
03:10:08,160 --> 03:10:14,800
executed the way that I think it should

4517
03:10:11,720 --> 03:10:16,479
have I go into the stores you know like

4518
03:10:14,800 --> 03:10:19,200
I I know the company and I think we're

4519
03:10:16,479 --> 03:10:20,439
we're not we're not our best right now

4520
03:10:19,200 --> 03:10:22,720
why did I write the

4521
03:10:20,439 --> 03:10:25,319
letter I didn't write the letter because

4522
03:10:22,720 --> 03:10:28,080
he had a bad interview on Kramer this on

4523
03:10:25,319 --> 03:10:30,920
LinkedIn yeah I wrote the letter because

4524
03:10:28,080 --> 03:10:33,520
I had written a couple of other

4525
03:10:30,920 --> 03:10:36,880
letters probably the iconic letter I

4526
03:10:33,520 --> 03:10:38,479
wrote was entitled the soul of the brand

4527
03:10:36,880 --> 03:10:40,239
and I was writing that letter because I

4528
03:10:38,479 --> 03:10:42,239
was a I don't get financial information

4529
03:10:40,239 --> 03:10:43,720
so I don't have any understanding

4530
03:10:42,239 --> 03:10:46,279
whether the company's making the cord or

4531
03:10:43,720 --> 03:10:48,000
not I was as surprised as anyone else to

4532
03:10:46,279 --> 03:10:51,920
see the dramatic

4533
03:10:48,000 --> 03:10:53,439
drop in revenue and in profit but I

4534
03:10:51,920 --> 03:10:55,479
wrote the soul of the brand because I

4535
03:10:53,439 --> 03:10:57,160
could smell

4536
03:10:55,479 --> 03:10:58,920
instinctively that there were things

4537
03:10:57,160 --> 03:11:01,640
going on that just did not feel right to

4538
03:10:58,920 --> 03:11:04,600
me that the shine was off the brand that

4539
03:11:01,640 --> 03:11:05,520
Partners were maybe not as inspired as

4540
03:11:04,600 --> 03:11:08,560
they had

4541
03:11:05,520 --> 03:11:10,840
been the first thing I want to say is

4542
03:11:08,560 --> 03:11:13,399
I've made it clear to the Starbucks

4543
03:11:10,840 --> 03:11:15,800
board Howard Schultz and I've made it

4544
03:11:13,399 --> 03:11:18,040
clear to lockman Howard Schultz has no

4545
03:11:15,800 --> 03:11:21,279
desire or intent

4546
03:11:18,040 --> 03:11:24,359
to return as CEO of Starbucks if you

4547
03:11:21,279 --> 03:11:26,920
want I'll say it again but I

4548
03:11:24,359 --> 03:11:29,720
don't but I can't

4549
03:11:26,920 --> 03:11:32,439
ignore what we've just discussed for the

4550
03:11:29,720 --> 03:11:34,160
last few hours if the company is do a

4551
03:11:32,439 --> 03:11:36,760
drift towards

4552
03:11:34,160 --> 03:11:40,200
mediocrity and I hold leadership and the

4553
03:11:36,760 --> 03:11:44,479
board responsible for that and my letter

4554
03:11:40,200 --> 03:11:47,880
was not accusatory my letter was not

4555
03:11:44,479 --> 03:11:51,279
predatory my letter was steeped in

4556
03:11:47,880 --> 03:11:54,720
counsel and advice based on 40 plus

4557
03:11:51,279 --> 03:11:57,000
years of experience in building this

4558
03:11:54,720 --> 03:11:58,960
company that's the advice in counsel I'm

4559
03:11:57,000 --> 03:12:01,399
giving you if you want to take the

4560
03:11:58,960 --> 03:12:03,040
advice it's up to you if you don't

4561
03:12:01,399 --> 03:12:06,600
you're responsible for the

4562
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:09,800
outcome and so I'm I'm not I have no

4563
03:12:06,600 --> 03:12:12,200
operational role I'm not on the board

4564
03:12:09,800 --> 03:12:14,640
and I'm watching from afar in rooting

4565
03:12:12,200 --> 03:12:17,160
and cheering for Starbucks and I wrote

4566
03:12:14,640 --> 03:12:19,960
the letter in hope that it would be a c

4567
03:12:17,160 --> 03:12:21,800
cyst for a positive interpretation and

4568
03:12:19,960 --> 03:12:26,800
what were your recommendations in the

4569
03:12:21,800 --> 03:12:30,520
letter the one thing is we're not a

4570
03:12:26,800 --> 03:12:33,120
beverage company serving coffee we are a

4571
03:12:30,520 --> 03:12:35,760
coffee company serving

4572
03:12:33,120 --> 03:12:36,840
people and we need to be much more

4573
03:12:35,760 --> 03:12:40,439
coffee

4574
03:12:36,840 --> 03:12:44,319
forward and we cannot continue to

4575
03:12:40,439 --> 03:12:47,200
allow the mobile app to be a runaway

4576
03:12:44,319 --> 03:12:49,920
train that is going to cons consistently

4577
03:12:47,200 --> 03:12:52,800
lute the Integrity of the experience of

4578
03:12:49,920 --> 03:12:55,880
Starbucks we're not in the transaction

4579
03:12:52,800 --> 03:12:57,920
business we have to we have to execute

4580
03:12:55,880 --> 03:13:00,520
transactions but that has to go through

4581
03:12:57,920 --> 03:13:04,080
the lens of being an experienced

4582
03:13:00,520 --> 03:13:06,520
business an experienced place people are

4583
03:13:04,080 --> 03:13:09,439
longing for human connection even if

4584
03:13:06,520 --> 03:13:11,840
they're on a mobile app let's provide

4585
03:13:09,439 --> 03:13:15,680
it but I also recognize this is a

4586
03:13:11,840 --> 03:13:17,720
complex time it's difficult uh but

4587
03:13:15,680 --> 03:13:19,880
that's your job yeah

4588
